/***************************************************************************************************
*
*   -- The "Situation" Advanced Platform Awareness, Control, and Timing --
*   Core API library v2.3.4L "Velocity" (Hotfix L)
*   (c) 2025 Jacques Morel
*   MIT Licenced
*
*   A single-file, cross-platform C/C++ library providing unified, low-level access and control over essential application subsystems. Its purpose is to abstract away platform-specific complexities,
*   offering a lean yet powerful API for building sophisticated, high-performance software.
*
*   The library's philosophy is reflected in its name, granting developers complete situational "Awareness," precise "Control," and fine-grained "Timing."
*
*   **New in v2.3.4 "Velocity":**
*   This release introduces the **Hot-Reloading Module**, a development-focused toolset that allows Shaders, Compute Pipelines, Textures, and 3D Models to be reloaded from disk at runtime.
*   This eliminates the need to restart the application to see asset changes, significantly increasing iteration speed for visual adjustments and shader programming.
*
*   It provides deep **Awareness** of the host system through APIs for querying hardware and multi-monitor display information, and by handling operating system events like window focus and file drops.
*
*   This foundation enables precise **Control** over the entire application stack, from window management (fullscreen, borderless) and input devices (keyboard, mouse, gamepad) to a comprehensive audio
*   pipeline with playback, capture, and real-time effects. This control extends to the graphics and compute pipeline, abstracting modern OpenGL and Vulkan through a unified command-buffer model.
*   It offers simplified management of GPU resources—such as shaders, meshes, and textures—and includes powerful utilities for high-quality text rendering and robust filesystem I/O.
*
*   Finally, its **Timing** capabilities range from high-resolution performance measurement and frame rate management to an advanced **Temporal Oscillator System** for creating complex, rhythmically
*   synchronized events. By handling the foundational boilerplate of platform interaction, "Situation" empowers developers to focus on core application logic, enabling the creation of responsive and
*   sophisticated software—from games and creative coding projects to data visualization tools—across all major desktop platforms.

Compilation command (adjust paths/libs for your system):
GCC (Linux/MinGW):
gcc main.c -o situation_demo \
    -I. -I./ext -I./ext/glad/include -I./ext/GLFW  # Adjust include paths for headers
    -L/path/to/glfw/libs                           # If GLFW lib is not in standard path
    -lglfw3 -lGL -lm -ldl -lpthread                # Common Linux libs
    # For MinGW on Windows, add Windows specific libs:
    # -lgdi32 -lopengl32 -lwinmm -luser32 -lshell32 -liphlpapi -lsetupapi -ldxgi -lole32 -lpropsys -lshlwapi
Use code with caution.
Bash
If you installed GLFW, Miniaudio, GLAD headers, and CGLM headers via a package manager like pacman in MSYS2/MinGW, the -I flags for them might not be needed if they are in the compiler's default search paths.
 However, you'll still need -I. if situation.h is in the current directory and #include "ext/glad.c" implies ext is a subdirectory.
A more self-contained MinGW command assuming headers are somewhat organized:
gcc main.c -o situation_demo.exe -I. -Iext \
    -lglfw3 -lsqlite3 \ # If you had sqlite3 (not used by situation.h but by earlier tests)
    -lgdi32 -lopengl32 -lwinmm -luser32 -lshell32 -lole32 -liphlpapi -lsetupapi -ldxgi -lpropsys -lshlwapi \
    -lm
Use code with caution.
Bash
(Note: The -lsqlite3 might not be needed if your situation.h doesn't use it, but your earlier test program did. The provided situation.h doesn't list SQLite3 as a direct dependency).

 * Feature Test Macros (Strict C11 Support)
 * ----------------------------------------
 * When compiling with strict standard flags (e.g., -std=c11), compilers like GCC and Clang disable non-standard extensions by default. This hides common OS-level functions
 * that are part of POSIX but not ISO C.
 *
 * We define these macros to explicitly request POSIX.1-2008 and X/Open 7 support.
 * This exposes necessary APIs required by the implementation, specifically:
 * - Filesystem queries: stat(), S_ISREG, S_ISDIR
 * - System interaction: readlink(), nanosleep()
 *
 * NOTE: These must be defined before ANY system headers are included.

//   • Real-time safe where applicable (especially audio-related callbacks)
//   • Zero-overhead (no virtual calls, no hidden allocations)
//   • Fully user-data driven (last parameter is always the pointer you supplied)
//
//  Never call other SITAPI functions from inside a callback unless the documentation for that specific callback explicitly declares it safe.
//
//  These signatures are frozen — they will never change in any future version.

/**
 * @brief Strategy for loading audio data from disk.
 * @details This enum allows the user to control the trade-off between RAM usage and CPU/Disk latency.
 *
 * - **SITUATION_AUDIO_LOAD_AUTO:** The recommended default. Automatically selects the strategy based on file duration.
 *   Files shorter than ~10 seconds are fully decoded to RAM (safest for SFX). Longer files are streamed.
 * - **SITUATION_AUDIO_LOAD_FULL:** Forces the entire audio file to be decoded into a raw PCM buffer in RAM upon load.
 *   - *Pros:* Zero disk I/O during playback; impossible to stutter during gameplay; perfectly thread-safe.
 *   - *Cons:* Higher RAM usage. High load times for long music tracks.
 * - **SITUATION_AUDIO_LOAD_STREAM:** Forces the audio engine to read from the file on disk during playback.
 *   - *Pros:* Minimal RAM usage; instant load times.
 *   - *Cons:* Risk of audio stuttering if the OS disk cache misses or if the drive is busy (e.g., loading textures).

//  SITUATION API USAGE GUIDE - v2.3.4 "Velocity"
//
//  This is the canonical reference for correct usage of the Situation library.
//  Every rule here is deliberate and enforced for maximum performance, identical cross-backend

//  Read this once. Then read it again. Then keep it open while you code.

/**
 * @section Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)
 *
 * 1. Single-Threaded API
 *    All SITAPI functions (windowing, input polling, rendering, resource creation)
 *    MUST be called from the main thread that called SituationInit().
 *    Background threads may perform pure CPU work or prepare data, but never call the API directly.
 *
 * 2. Update-Before-Draw Contract (CRITICAL FOR BACKEND PARITY)
 *    You MUST update buffers / push constants / textures
 *    THEN you record draw commands.
 *    Never the other way around.
 *    In debug builds the library actively detects violations and aborts with a clear error.
 *    This guarantees pixel-identical results between OpenGL (immediate) and Vulkan (deferred).
 *
 * 3. Explicit Resource Ownership
 *    SituationCreate*  → must be paired with SituationDestroy*
 *    SituationLoad*    → must be paired with SituationUnload*
 *    SituationTakeScreenshot(), SituationGetLastErrorMsg(), SituationGetBasePath(), etc.
 *      → return heap-allocated data → caller must SIT_FREE() or SituationFreeString().
 *    SituationShutdown() performs leak detection and prints warnings for any GPU resource still alive.
 *
 * 4. Handle Pattern (by value) vs Modification (by pointer)
 *    - Use:    SituationCmdDrawMesh(mesh_handle);          // pass by value
 *    - Destroy: SituationDestroyMesh(&mesh_handle);        // pass by pointer → handle is zeroed
 *    This pattern is used everywhere and prevents use-after-free bugs.
 */

/**
 * @section Recommended Main Loop (Velocity-Era Standard)
 *
 * while (!SituationWindowShouldClose()) {
 *     SITUATION_BEGIN_FRAME();           // Polls input + updates timers in correct order
 *
 *     // ── Your Update Logic Here (physics, gameplay, audio triggers, hot-reload checks) ──
 *     SituationCheckHotReloads();        // Optional but highly recommended in development
 *
 *     if (SituationAcquireFrameCommandBuffer()) {
 *         SituationCommandBuffer cmd = SituationGetMainCommandBuffer();
 *
 *         // ── Update GPU data first (buffers, push constants, descriptor binds) ──
 *
 *         // ── Then record draw commands ──
 *         SituationCmdBeginRenderPass(cmd, &main_pass_info);
 *         SituationCmdDrawMesh(cmd, my_mesh);
 *         SituationCmdDrawText(cmd, font, "Situation v2.3.4F", vec2(10,10), WHITE);
 *         SituationCmdEndRenderPass(cmd);
 *
 *         SituationEndFrame();               // Presents + GPU submit
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * This structure is now the official recommended pattern as of v2.3.4.
 */

/**
 * @section Hot-Reloading Workflow (The "Velocity" Killer Feature)
 *
 * In development builds:
 *   - Call SituationCheckHotReloads() once per frame (usually right after SITUATION_BEGIN_FRAME()).
 *   - Any shader, compute pipeline, texture, or GLTF model that was loaded with the normal
 *     SituationLoad* functions will automatically reload when the file on disk changes.
 *   - Original handles remain valid → no need to rebuild materials, UI, or scene graphs.
 *
 * This feature alone typically doubles or triples artist/programmer iteration speed.
 */

/**
 * @section Zero-Friction Features (They Just Work™)
 *
 *  SituationLoadSoundFromFile("music.mp3", SITUATION_AUDIO_LOAD_AUTO, true, &snd);
 *  SituationLoadTexture("tex.png", true, &tex);           // mips + hot-reload ready
 *  SituationTakeScreenshot("shot.png");            // always PNG, always works
 *  SituationLoadFont("font.ttf") → SituationBakeFontAtlas() → SituationCmdDrawText()
 *
 * No extra defines, no manual stb includes, no custom writers required.
 */

/**
 * @section Final Checklist Before Shipping
 *
 * [ ] Remove or #ifdef out SituationCheckHotReloads() in release builds
 * [ ] Disable validation layers (SituationInitInfo::enable_vulkan_validation = false)
 * [ ] Verify SituationShutdown() prints "No resource leaks detected"
 * [ ] Confirm no "update-after-draw" assertions in debug builds
 *
 * If you can tick all boxes, you have achieved Situation mastery.

    // If the pipeline layout is only for push constants, this might not be needed. Let's assume for now it's needed for general resource binding associated with the pipeline.
    // However, typically, resources like SSBOs/UBOs are bound per-draw/dispatch using their own sets.
    // Binding the pipeline's *layout* itself doesn't usually require a descriptor set.
    // Let's re-evaluate. The pipeline layout defines the interface. Descriptor sets are bound *to* that interface.
    // So, the pipeline layout itself doesn't need a descriptor set.
    // But, if the pipeline uses descriptor sets (which it does), and we want to pre-allocate sets for *those bindings* (like SSBOs/UBOs used by shaders in this pipeline),
    // those sets are owned by the *resources* (SituationBuffer), not the pipeline.
    // The pipeline just defines the layout that those resource sets must conform to.
    // Therefore, SituationComputePipeline likely does NOT need its own descriptor_set member for this fix.
    // The fix is for buffers/images that are *used by* the pipeline.
    // The pipeline layout is used in vkCmdBindDescriptorSets to specify *which* layout the bound sets conform to.
    // Conclusion: No change needed for SituationComputePipeline struct for this specific buffer binding performance fix.
    // The fix is in SituationBuffer and how it's used in binding calls.

/**
 * @section Shader Contract
 * @brief Defines the standard resource binding locations for all shaders used with this library.
 * @details To ensure that the engine can correctly and consistently bind resources (vertex data, uniforms, textures) to any shader, all GLSL shaders must adhere to this predefined contract.
 *          The contract uses a unified set of constants that map to the appropriate backend-specific syntax (`layout(location=...)` for OpenGL attributes, `layout(set=..., binding=...)` for Vulkan resources, etc.).
 *
 * @par Vulkan Descriptor Set Layout
 *   In Vulkan, resources are organized into Descriptor Sets. This contract defines a standard layout:
 *   - **Set 0: Per-View/Frame Resources:** Contains UBOs with data that is updated once per frame or per camera (e.g., projection matrix, time).
 *   - **Set 1: Per-Material Resources:** Contains samplers for material-specific textures (e.g., albedo, normal maps).
 *   - **Set 2+: Per-Object/Dynamic Resources:** Reserved for more dynamic, per-draw-call resources if needed.
 *   - **Push Constants:** Used for small, extremely high-frequency data (e.g., model matrix, object color), passed without a descriptor set.

 * @shader SIT_COMPOSITE_SHADER
 * @brief An advanced shader for compositing with Photoshop-style blend modes.
 * @details This shader is used when a Virtual Display is configured with a blend mode that requires knowledge of the destination color (e.g., Overlay, Soft Light).
 *          It reads from both the source texture (the VD) and the destination framebuffer (copied to a texture) to calculate the final blended color.
 *
 * @var u_sourceTexture (uniform) The sampler for the source Virtual Display's texture.
 * @var u_destinationTexture (uniform) A sampler containing a copy of the framebuffer content that is *behind* the current virtual display.
 * @var pc.blendMode (uniform, Vulkan) An integer representing the blend mode to apply.
 * @var u_blendMode (uniform, OpenGL) An integer representing the blend mode to apply.

 * 1.  Calculates the hash of the `key`.
 * 2.  Determines the bucket index using `hash % capacity`.
 * 3.  Searches the linked list at that bucket for the key.
 * 4.  If found, updates the existing entry's value.
 * 5.  If not found, allocates a new entry, duplicates the key string, sets the value, and prepends the new entry to the bucket's linked list.
 *
 * @param map A pointer to the `_SituationUniformMap` struct to modify.
 * @param key A null-terminated C string representing the uniform name (the key).
 * @param value The GLint value (typically the uniform location) to associate with the key.
 *
 * @note This function performs memory allocation for new keys and map entries.
 *       If allocation fails, the function returns silently without adding the entry.
 *       This is generally acceptable for a cache mechanism.
 * @note The function currently does not implement dynamic resizing of the hash table.
 *       If the number of entries (`map->count`) grows significantly larger than the `map->capacity`, performance may degrade due to longer linked list chains.

 *   2.  **Polling-Based:** It then creates a deep copy of the file path list and stores it in the global state (`sit_gs.dropped_file_paths`). It also sets the `sit_gs.file_was_dropped_this_frame` flag. This allows the polling functions `SituationIsFileDropped()` and `SituationLoadDroppedFiles()` to work correctly.
 *
 * @param window The GLFW window that received the event (unused).
 * @param count The number of files that were dropped.
 * @param paths An array of null-terminated, UTF-8 encoded strings, where each string is the absolute path to a dropped file. The memory for this array is managed by GLFW and is only valid for the duration of the callback.

 *   Upon invocation, this function updates several aspects of the internal keyboard state:
 *   - **Current State:** Updates the `sit_gs.keyboard.current_state` array, which is used by `SituationIsKeyDown()`.
 *   - **Event Flags:** Sets the `down_this_frame` or `up_this_frame` flags for the specific key, which are used by `SituationIsKeyPressed()` and `SituationIsKeyReleased()`.
 *   - **Event Queue:** On a key press, it pushes the key code onto a mutex-protected queue for consumption by `SituationGetKeyPressed()`.
 *   - **Modifier State:** It updates the global modifier flags (`sit_gs.keyboard.modifier_state`) for Shift, Ctrl, Alt, etc.
 *   - **Lock Key State:** It specifically tracks the state of lock keys like Caps Lock and Num Lock.
 *   - **Scroll Lock:** It manually toggles the internal `is_scroll_lock_on` flag, as this state is not provided as a standard modifier.
 *
 * It also dispatches the event to the optional user-registered key callback.
 *
 * @param window The GLFW window that received the event (unused).
 * @param key The keyboard key that was pressed or released (e.g., `GLFW_KEY_A`).
 * @param scancode The system-specific scancode of the key (unused).
 * @param action The key action (`GLFW_PRESS`, `GLFW_RELEASE`, `GLFW_REPEAT`).
 * @param mods A bitfield describing which modifier keys were held down.
 *
 * @note This function is for internal use only.
 * @warning Although GLFW may invoke this callback from a different thread in some theoretical configurations, this library's design assumes it is called synchronously during `SituationPollInputEvents()`.
 * The mutex is included as a robust safeguard for thread safety, preparing the library for future evolution.

 *   The function's primary responsibility is to update the library's internal state and trigger necessary backend-specific actions:
 *   1.  **State Update:** It updates the library's cached render dimensions (`sit_gs.main_window_width`/`height`) and sets the `was_window_resized_last_frame` flag for the polling API.
 *   2.  **OpenGL Backend:** It immediately updates the OpenGL state by calling `glViewport` and recalculating internal orthographic projection matrices. This is safe because OpenGL is an immediate-mode API.
 *   3.  **Vulkan Backend:** It **does not** perform any immediate resource recreation. Instead, it simply sets the `sit_gs.vk.framebuffer_resized` flag. This is a critical design choice, as recreating the Vulkan swapchain is a complex, blocking operation that cannot be safely performed inside an asynchronous callback. The main render loop will detect this flag and handle the recreation gracefully.
 *   4.  **User Callback:** Finally, it invokes the optional user-defined callback set via `SituationSetResizeCallback`, allowing the application to respond to the size change.
 *
 * @param window The GLFW window that received the event (unused).
 * @param width The new width of the framebuffer in pixels.

 * @details This is the main entry point and the first function a user of the library must call. It orchestrates the complete initialization process by setting up all necessary subsystems in a specific, dependency-respecting order:
 * 1.  **Platform:** Initializes low-level libraries like GLFW.
 * 2.  **Window:** Creates the main application window.
 * 3.  **Renderer:** Initializes the selected graphics backend (OpenGL or Vulkan), including contexts/devices, swapchains, internal pipelines, etc.
 * 4.  **Subsystems:** Initializes audio, input handling, timer system, filesystem utilities, and other core functionalities.
 *
 * If any step in this sequence fails, the function triggers a comprehensive cleanup process (`_SituationFullCleanupOnError`) to ensure that no resources
 * are leaked and the library is left in a clean, uninitialized state.
 *
 * @param argc The number of command-line arguments, including the program name.
 *             This is typically the `argc` parameter from the `main` function.
 * @param argv An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
 *             This is typically the `argv` parameter from the `main` function.
 *             The library stores these for later querying via argument functions.
 * @param init_info A pointer to a `SituationInitInfo` struct containing all necessary configuration options for the library's initialization (e.g., window title, dimensions, initial flags).
 *                  This pointer must not be NULL.
 *
 * @return SITUATION_SUCCESS on successful initialization of all subsystems.
 * @return SITUATION_ERROR_INVALID_PARAM if `init_info` is NULL.
 * @return SITUATION_ERROR_ALREADY_INITIALIZED if `SituationInit` is called more than once without an intervening `SituationShutdown`.
 * @return SITUATION_ERROR_INIT_FAILED if any part of the initialization sequence fails (e.g., GLFW failure, graphics context creation failure,
 *         audio device failure). A specific error code and message will be set by the failing subsystem's initialization function. Cleanup is attempted.
 * @return SITUATION_ERROR_SHUTDOWN_FAILED if a previous call to `SituationShutdown` failed and left the library in an inconsistent state, preventing re-initialization.
 *         This is a safeguard to avoid attempting initialization from a bad state.
 *
 * @note This function must be called before any other `SITAPI` functions (except potentially other init/shutdown functions).
 * @note The library is designed to be initialized and shut down once per application run. While re-initialization after a successful shutdown
 *       is intended to work, it's generally recommended to structure the application's main lifecycle around a single init/shutdown pair.

 * @brief [INTERNAL] Initializes the OpenGL rendering backend and all internal OpenGL resources.
 * @details This is the master function for setting up the OpenGL environment. It is called once during `SituationInit` after the GLFW window and an OpenGL context have been successfully created.
 *
 * @par Initialization Sequence
 *   1.  **Context & Function Loading:** It makes the GLFW window's OpenGL context current for the calling thread and then uses GLAD to load all necessary modern OpenGL function pointers.
 *   2.  **Version & Extension Validation:** It verifies that the available OpenGL version meets the library's minimum requirement (e.g., OpenGL 4.6) and that critical extensions (like `GL_ARB_direct_state_access`) are supported.
 *   3.  **Global VAO Abstraction:** It creates and binds a single, global Vertex Array Object (`sit_gs.gl.global_vao_id`).
 *           This VAO remains active for all user rendering commands, providing a crucial abstraction layer that simplifies vertex attribute management and is essential for the `SituationCreateMesh` and `SituationCmd*` API to function correctly.
 *   4.  **Internal Renderers:** It initializes the library's private rendering modules, such as the 2D quad renderer and the virtual display compositors. These modules create their own private VAOs and shaders to ensure their state does not interfere with the user's global VAO.
 *   5.  **Global UBO:** It creates and binds the global Uniform Buffer Object for per-view data (e.g., camera matrices) to its standard binding point (`SIT_UBO_BINDING_VIEW_DATA`).
 *   6.  **Initial State:** It sets the initial VSync state (`glfwSwapInterval`) and default clear color based on the user's `init_info`.
 *
 * @param init_info A pointer to the `SituationInitInfo` struct, containing user-defined configuration like the VSync hint.
 *
 * @return `SITUATION_SUCCESS` on successful initialization of all OpenGL components.
 * @return An appropriate `SituationError` code if any phase fails (e.g., GLAD fails to load, version is too old, an internal renderer fails to initialize).
 *
 * @note This function is for internal use by `_SituationInitRenderer` only.
 * @warning The creation and binding of the `global_vao_id` is a cornerstone of the OpenGL backend's design. All user-facing mesh and drawing functions rely on this VAO being active.

 * @brief [INTERNAL] Initializes Vulkan pipelines for the Virtual Display Compositing system.
 * @details This function is the second stage of internal renderer setup. It compiles and creates the specific graphics pipelines used by `SituationRenderVirtualDisplays` to draw off-screen framebuffers onto the main screen.
 *
 * @par Scope
 * This function creates two distinct pipelines:
 * 1. **Simple Compositor:** For standard blending (Alpha, Additive, Multiply). Uses a lightweight shader and single texture sampling.
 * 2. **Advanced Compositor:** For complex "Photoshop-style" blend modes (Overlay, Soft Light, etc.). Uses a specialized shader that samples both the source Virtual Display and a copy of the destination framebuffer.
 *
 * @note The standard 2D Quad Renderer (`SituationCmdDrawQuad`) is **not** initialized here; it is handled by the shared `_SituationInitQuadRenderer` function before this one is called.
 *
 * @par Initialization Sequence
 *   1. **Simple Compositor:**
 *      - Compiles `SIT_VD_VERTEX_SHADER_SRC` and `SIT_VD_FRAGMENT_SHADER_SRC`.
 *      - Creates a pipeline layout with: Set 0 (View UBO), Set 1 (Source Sampler), and Push Constants.
 *      - Creates the `vd_compositing_pipeline`.
 *   2. **Advanced Compositor:**
 *      - Compiles `SIT_COMPOSITE_VERTEX_SHADER_SRC` and `SIT_COMPOSITE_FRAGMENT_SHADER_SRC`.
 *      - Creates a pipeline layout with: Set 0 (View UBO), Set 1 (Source Sampler), Set 2 (Dest Sampler), and Push Constants.
 *      - Creates the `advanced_compositing_pipeline`.
 *
 * @return SITUATION_SUCCESS on successful initialization of both pipelines.
 * @return SITUATION_ERROR_VULKAN_PIPELINE_CREATION_FAILED if shader compilation or pipeline creation fails. Cleanup is performed automatically on failure.
 *
 * @warning This function relies on the shader compiler being enabled (`SITUATION_ENABLE_SHADER_COMPILER`). If disabled, it returns success immediately but leaves the pipeline handles as `VK_NULL_HANDLE`, effectively disabling Virtual Displays.

 * @brief [INTERNAL] Allocates and begins recording a temporary, primary-level Vulkan command buffer.
 *
 * @details This helper function is a standard and convenient way to execute short, one-off sequences of Vulkan commands (e.g., image layout transitions, buffer copies, setting image data). It simplifies the process by:
 * 1.  Allocating a single primary command buffer from the library's main command pool (`sit_gs.vk.command_pool`).
 * 2.  Beginning recording on that buffer with the `VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_ONE_TIME_SUBMIT_BIT` flag, indicating it will be submitted once and then discarded.
 *
 * @par Typical Usage Pattern
 * The caller uses this function to get a command buffer, records commands into it using `vkCmd*` functions, and then calls
 * `_SituationVulkanEndSingleTimeCommands` to end recording, submit the commands to the graphics queue, wait for completion, and clean up the buffer.
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * VkCommandBuffer cmd = _SituationVulkanBeginSingleTimeCommands();
 * if (cmd == VK_NULL_HANDLE) { // Handle allocation/error } // Check added for robustness
 * // Record commands, e.g., vkCmdPipelineBarrier, vkCmdCopyBuffer...
 * _SituationVulkanEndSingleTimeCommands(cmd); // Handles submission, wait, and cleanup
 * @endcode
 *
 * @return A valid `VkCommandBuffer` handle ready for command recording.
 * @return `VK_NULL_HANDLE` if the library is not initialized, if the Vulkan device or command pool is invalid, or if allocation/beginning fails.
 *         A specific error message is set via `_SituationSetErrorFromCode`.
 *
 * @note This function is for internal library use and is not part of the public API.
 * @note It is the caller's sole responsibility to pass the returned `VkCommandBuffer` handle to `_SituationVulkanEndSingleTimeCommands` to ensure proper submission, synchronization, and cleanup.
 *       Failing to do so will result in resource leaks.
 * @warning This function allocates a command buffer. Not calling `_SituationVulkanEndSingleTimeCommands` will leak this resource.
 * @warning This function is synchronous; `_SituationVulkanEndSingleTimeCommands` calls `vkQueueWaitIdle`, blocking the CPU until the commands complete.

 * @brief [INTERNAL] Ends recording, submits, waits for completion, and cleans up a one-time-use command buffer.
 *
 * @details This helper function completes the lifecycle of a temporary command buffer created by `_SituationVulkanBeginSingleTimeCommands`. It performs the following essential steps:
 * 1.  Ends the recording of the command buffer.
 * 2.  Submits the command buffer to the graphics queue (`sit_gs.vk.graphics_queue`) for execution.
 * 3.  Waits for the graphics queue to become idle (`vkQueueWaitIdle`), ensuring that all commands recorded in the buffer have finished executing on the GPU.
 *     This makes the function synchronous.
 * 4.  Frees the command buffer back to the pool (`sit_gs.vk.command_pool`) from which it was allocated.
 *
 * @par Typical Usage Pattern
 * This function is always paired with `_SituationVulkanBeginSingleTimeCommands`.
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * VkCommandBuffer cmd = _SituationVulkanBeginSingleTimeCommands();
 * if (cmd == VK_NULL_HANDLE) { // Handle allocation/error }
 * // Record commands, e.g., vkCmdPipelineBarrier, vkCmdCopyBuffer...
 * _SituationVulkanEndSingleTimeCommands(cmd); // Handles submission, wait, and cleanup
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param command_buffer The `VkCommandBuffer` handle returned by `_SituationVulkanBeginSingleTimeCommands`. This handle must be valid.
 *
 * @note This function is for internal library use and is not part of the public API.
 * @note This function is synchronous due to the `vkQueueWaitIdle` call. It will block the calling thread until the GPU has finished executing the commands.
 * @note It is crucial that the `command_buffer` parameter is the handle returned by `_SituationVulkanBeginSingleTimeCommands` and has not been previously ended or submitted.
 * @warning Failing to call this function after obtaining a command buffer from `_SituationVulkanBeginSingleTimeCommands` will result in a resource leak.
 * @warning Calling this function with an invalid or already-ended `command_buffer` handle can lead to undefined behavior or validation errors.

 *
 * @par Expected File Format
 * The file pointed to by `filename` is expected to be a raw binary file containing the compiled SPIR-V bytecode. No text parsing or conversion is performed.

 * @param[out] out_size A pointer to a `size_t` variable where the size of the read data (in bytes) will be stored. This pointer must not be NULL.
 *
 * @return A pointer to a newly allocated block of memory containing the raw bytes of the SPIR-V file.
 *         - The caller takes ownership of this memory and is responsible for calling `free()` on the returned pointer when it is no longer needed.
 *         - The memory block is guaranteed to be at least `*out_size` bytes long and null-terminated (an extra byte is allocated and set to 0, though the SPIR-V data itself is binary and might contain 0s).
 * @return NULL if the function fails. This can happen if:
 *         - `filename` is NULL.
 *         - `out_size` is NULL.
 *         - `SituationLoadFileData` fails to open or read the file (e.g., file not found, permission denied, read error).
 *         - Memory allocation fails.
 *         In case of failure, `*out_size` is set to 0, and a specific error message is set via `_SituationSetErrorFromCode` (inherited from `SituationLoadFileData` or generated by this function).
 *
 * @note This function is for internal library use and is not part of the public API.
 * @note The returned pointer points to memory allocated using the standard `malloc`.
 *       It must be freed using the standard `free`.
 * @warning The caller must check the return value for NULL before using it.
 * @warning The contents of the returned buffer are raw binary data and should be treated as such. Casting it to other types (e.g., `uint32_t*` for

/**
 * @brief [INTERNAL] Creates a complete Vulkan graphics pipeline from pre-compiled SPIR-V shader files.
 * @details This is a core, high-level helper function for the Vulkan backend that orchestrates the entire process of creating a `VkPipeline`. It is a simplified entry point that assumes a standard vertex format and rendering state suitable for typical 3D rendering.
 *
 * @par Creation Process
 *   1.  **Load SPIR-V:** It reads the raw SPIR-V bytecode from the vertex and fragment shader files specified by `vs_path` and `fs_path`.
 *   2.  **Create Shader Modules:** It creates `VkShaderModule` objects from the loaded bytecode.
 *   3.  **Define Pipeline State:** It configures all the necessary creation info structs for a standard graphics pipeline, including:
 *       - `VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo`: Defines the vertex and fragment shader stages.
 *       - `VkPipelineVertexInputStateCreateInfo`: Defines the vertex data layout (this is currently hardcoded and assumes no specific vertex input, which is a simplification).
 *       - `VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo`: Sets the primitive topology to triangle lists.
 *       - `VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo`: Configures the viewport and scissor to be dynamic states.
 *       - `VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo`: Sets standard rasterization state (e.g., fill mode, back-face culling).
 *       - `VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo`: Disables multisampling.
 *       - `VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo`: Enables depth testing and writing.
 *       - `VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo`: Configures standard alpha blending.
 *   4.  **Create Pipeline Layout:** It currently reuses a pre-existing, simple pipeline layout. A more advanced implementation would create or select a layout compatible with the specific shader's resource requirements.
 *   5.  **Create Graphics Pipeline:** It assembles all the state information into a `VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo` struct and calls `vkCreateGraphicsPipelines` to create the final `VkPipeline` object.
 *   6.  **Cleanup:** The temporary `VkShaderModule` objects are destroyed after the pipeline is successfully created.
 *
 * @param vs_path The file system path to the compiled vertex shader SPIR-V file (`.spv`).
 * @param fs_path The file system path to the compiled fragment shader SPIR-V file (`.spv`).
 *
 * @return A `SituationShader` handle populated with the created `vk_pipeline` and `vk_pipeline_layout`.
 * @return A zeroed (invalid) `SituationShader` handle if any step in the process fails (e.g., file not found, shader module creation fails, pipeline creation fails). A detailed error is set internally.
 *
 * @note This function is a simplified helper and makes several assumptions about the rendering state. For example, the vertex input state is hardcoded. A production-ready engine would have a more flexible system for defining pipeline state objects based on material or mesh properties.
 * @warning This function is for internal use only.

 * @details This is the master function for setting up the Vulkan environment. It is called once during `SituationInit` and executes a multi-phase sequence to create all necessary Vulkan objects, from the instance and device to the swapchain and internal renderers.
 *          This function is responsible for establishing the library's high-performance resource management models, including the persistent descriptor set infrastructure.
 *
 * @par Initialization Sequence
 *   The function proceeds through several distinct phases:
 *   1.  **Core API Setup:** Creates the `VkInstance`, validation layers (if enabled), `VkSurfaceKHR`, selects a suitable `VkPhysicalDevice`, and creates the `VkDevice`. It also initializes the Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA).
 *   2.  **Framing Setup:** Determines the optimal number of in-flight frames based on swapchain capabilities and allocates the per-frame arrays for command buffers, semaphores, and fences.
 *   3.  **Frame-Independent Resources:** Creates resources that are not tied to a specific frame, including the swapchain, main render pass, and depth buffer.
 *   4.  **Descriptor Infrastructure:** Critically, it initializes the **Dynamic Descriptor Manager**. It creates an initial "seed" `VkDescriptorPool` (`persistent_descriptor_pool`) and registers it with the manager. This allows the engine to automatically grow its descriptor capacity at runtime if the initial pool becomes full, preventing crashes during heavy asset streaming.
 *   5.  **Per-Frame Resources:** Creates the per-frame command buffers, synchronization objects (semaphores/fences), and the UBOs used for global view/projection data.
 *   6.  **Internal Renderers:** Initializes the pipelines and vertex buffers required for the library's internal rendering helpers, such as the 2D quad renderer.
 *
 * @param init_info A pointer to the `SituationInitInfo` struct, containing user-defined configuration like enabling validation layers and the window title.
 *
 * @return SITUATION_SUCCESS on successful initialization of all Vulkan components.
 * @return An appropriate `SituationError` code if any phase of the initialization fails. The function will halt on the first error and return immediately.
 *
 * @note This is a complex orchestrator function. Each sub-step (e.g., `_SituationVulkanCreateInstance`) is handled by a dedicated helper function for clarity and modularity.
 * @warning This function is for internal use by `SituationInit` only and must not be called directly.
 *          It assumes that `_SituationInitPlatform` and `_SituationInitWindow` have already been called successfully.

 *   2.  **Feature Enablement:** It specifies the set of `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures` to enable. Currently, this is an empty set, but it can be expanded to request features like geometry shaders or anisotropic filtering.
 *   3.  **Extension Enablement:** It builds a list of required device-level extensions. This always includes `VK_KHR_swapchain` for rendering to a window and may include platform-specific extensions like `"VK_KHR_portability_subset"` on macOS.
 *   4.  **Device Creation:** It calls `vkCreateDevice` with the configured queues, features, and extensions to create the logical device handle.
 *   5.  **Queue Handle Retrieval:** After the device is created, it calls `vkGetDeviceQueue` to retrieve the handles for the graphics and present queues, storing them in the global state for command submission and presentation.

 *   - **Device Type:** Discrete GPUs are heavily favored and receive a high score (+1000), while integrated GPUs receive a smaller bonus (+100).
 *   - **Capabilities:** Additional points are awarded for features like a larger maximum 2D texture dimension, indicating a more powerful GPU.

 *          2.  Destroys the main window's depth image view and the depth image itself (along with its VMA allocation).
 *          3.  Iterates through and destroys all main window framebuffers stored in `sit_gs.vk.main_window_framebuffers`.
 *          4.  Frees the `sit_gs.vk.main_window_framebuffers` array itself.

 *          6.  Frees the `sit_gs.vk.swapchain_image_views` array itself.
 *          7.  Destroys the `VkSwapchainKHR` handle (`sit_gs.vk.swapchain`).
 *
 *          Crucially, it leaves core, swapchain-independent resources intact, such as:
 *          - The `VkDevice` (`sit_gs.vk.device`)
 *          - The `VkPhysicalDevice` (`sit_gs.vk.physical_device`)

 *          - The `VkInstance` and `VkSurfaceKHR`
 *
 * @note This function should only be called when it's safe to destroy these resources, typically just before `_SituationVulkanCreateSwapchain` is called.
 * @note It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that:
 *       1. The Vulkan device (`sit_gs.vk.device`) is valid.

 *
 * @par Backend-Specific Implementation
 * - **OpenGL:**
 *   1.  Compiles and links a dedicated shader program from the internal `SIT_QUAD_VERTEX_SHADER` and `SIT_QUAD_FRAGMENT_SHADER` sources.
 *   2.  Creates a **private** Vertex Array Object (`sit_gs.gl.quad_vao`) and Vertex Buffer Object (`sit_gs.gl.quad_vbo`). This is a crucial step to isolate the quad renderer's state from the main user-facing VAO (`sit_gs.gl.global_vao_id`).
 *   3.  Uploads a static, 4-vertex triangle strip to the VBO.
 *   4.  Configures the private VAO with the correct vertex attribute layout for the simple 2D vertex format.
 *   5.  Sets the initial orthographic projection matrix uniform in the shader.
 *   6.  Critically, it restores the binding of the main global VAO before returning, ensuring the user's rendering context is left undisturbed.
 * - **Vulkan:**
 *   1.  Compiles the internal GLSL shader sources into SPIR-V using `shaderc`.

 *          The caller is responsible for assigning a public `id` to the returned struct and for adding it to any resource tracking systems.
 *          The caller is also responsible for eventually destroying the pipeline using `_SituationVulkanDestroyComputePipeline` or `SituationDestroyComputePipeline`.
 *          Error handling is performed internally. If this function fails, it returns an invalid `SituationComputePipeline` (zero-initialized) and sets the library's last error state via `_SituationSetErrorFromCode`.
 *

 *                      This data must be valid and correctly formatted SPIR-V.

 * @param cs_spirv_size Size of the SPIR-V bytecode in bytes.
 *                      Must be greater than 0 and typically a multiple of 4.
 *                      Must not be 0.
 * @return A `SituationComputePipeline` struct.
 *         - On **success**: The struct contains valid Vulkan handles (`.vk_pipeline`, `.vk_pipeline_layout`) and should be used with Vulkan binding/execution functions. The caller must assign a public `.id`.
 *         - On **failure**: The struct is zero-initialized (`{0}`), indicating an invalid pipeline. The specific error can be retrieved using `SituationGetLastErrorMsg()`.
 *
 * @note This function requires the library to be initialized (`SituationInit` must have been called successfully).
 * @note This function creates a pipeline layout with **no descriptor set layouts** and **no push constant ranges**.
 *       If the compute shader requires descriptors or push constants, this function (or the logic calling it) must be modified to provide the appropriate `VkDescriptorSetLayout` objects and `VkPushConstantRange` definitions when creating the `VkPipelineLayout`.
 * @note The `VkShaderModule` created internally is destroyed immediately after the `VkPipeline` is successfully created, as per Vulkan specification.
 *       The `VkShaderModule` handle is **not** stored in the returned struct.
 * @warning The SPIR-V data pointed to by `cs_spirv_data` is not validated by this function for semantic correctness beyond basic Vulkan object creation. Passing invalid SPIR-V can lead to errors during pipeline creation or undefined behavior at runtime.

 * @note The `VkShaderModule` is not destroyed here, as it is a temporary object that is destroyed immediately after the pipeline is created in `_SituationVulkanCreateComputePipeline`.

/**
 * @brief [INTERNAL] Generates a complete mipmap chain for a Vulkan image using sequential blits.
 * @details This helper function is responsible for creating all mipmap levels for a given texture, from the base level (mip 0) down to the final 1x1 level. It performs this by iteratively blitting from each mip level `i` to the next level `i+1`, which has half the dimensions.
 *          This process is essential for high-quality texture rendering, as it provides pre-filtered, lower-resolution versions of the texture for the GPU to sample from when the object is far from the camera, significantly reducing aliasing and shimmering artifacts.
 *
 * @par Synchronization and Workflow
 *   The function executes a precise, looped sequence of commands for each new mip level:
 *   1.  **Barrier:** It first records a `VkImageMemoryBarrier` to transition the layout of the *source* mip level (e.g., mip `i-1`) from `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL` to `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_SRC_OPTIMAL`.
 *       This ensures that the previous write operation (either the initial data copy or the previous blit) is complete and the memory is visible for reading.
 *   2.  **Blit:** It records a `vkCmdBlitImage` command. This command performs the downscaling operation, copying from the source mip level to the destination mip level (e.g., from mip `i-1` to mip `i`). Linear filtering is used to ensure a smooth, high-quality downsample.
 *   3.  **Barrier:** Immediately after the blit command, it records another barrier to transition the layout of the *source* mip level (`i-1`) from `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_SRC_OPTIMAL` to `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`.
 *       This makes the now-finalized mip level available for sampling by shaders.
 *
 * After the loop finishes, a final barrier is issued to transition the very last mip level to `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`.
 *
 * @param cmd The `VkCommandBuffer` (which must be in the recording state) into which the barrier and blit commands will be recorded.
 * @param image The `VkImage` for which to generate mipmaps. This image must have been created with `VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT` and `VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT` usage flags.
 * @param width The width of the base mip level (level 0).
 * @param height The height of the base mip level (level 0).
 * @param mip_levels The total number of mip levels in the image, including the base level.
 *
 * @note This function assumes that the base mip level (level 0) has already been populated with data and that all mip levels are currently in the `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL` layout.
 * @warning This function is for internal use by `SituationCreateTexture` only and should not be called directly.

/**
 * @brief [INTERNAL] Performs a comprehensive, robust cleanup of all library components in response to an initialization failure.
 * @details This is the primary error handling routine for the `SituationInit` function. It is designed to be called from any point during the initialization sequence if a critical failure occurs.
 *          Its purpose is to safely unwind the initialization process, releasing any resources that were successfully allocated before the point of failure to prevent leaks.
 *
 * @par Cleanup Strategy
 *   The function executes the main cleanup routines in the **exact reverse order of initialization** to respect dependencies (e.g., the Vulkan surface must be destroyed before the GLFW window).
 *   1.  **GPU Synchronization:** It first attempts to wait for the GPU to go idle (`vkDeviceWaitIdle` or `glFinish`). This is a critical step to ensure that no resources are in use by the GPU when destruction begins, preventing validation errors or crashes.
 *   2.  **Subsystem Teardown:** Calls `_SituationCleanupSubsystems` to release audio, input, and timer resources.
 *   3.  **Renderer Teardown:** Calls `_SituationCleanupRenderer` to dispatch to the backend-specific cleanup (`_SituationCleanupOpenGL` or `_SituationCleanupVulkan`).
 *   4.  **Platform Teardown:** Calls `_SituationCleanupPlatform` to destroy the window and terminate GLFW.
 *
 * The robustness of this function relies on the fact that each individual cleanup helper is idempotent and safely handles being called on a partially initialized state (i.e., by checking if resource handles are `NULL` before attempting to destroy them).
 *
 * @note This function is for internal use by `SituationInit` only and should never be called directly.
 * @warning After this function completes, the library is in a fully uninitialized state.

 * @see SituationInit(), _SituationCleanupSubsystems(), _SituationCleanupRenderer(), _SituationCleanupPlatform()

 *
 * @par Backend-Specific Behavior
 * - **OpenGL:**
 *   - Makes the main GLFW window's OpenGL context current for the calling thread.
 *   - Binds the default framebuffer (the main window's backbuffer).
 *   - Sets the viewport to cover the entire window area.

 * - **Vulkan:**
 *   - Waits for the GPU to finish processing the commands associated with the frame identified by `sit_gs.vk.current_frame_index`.
 *   - Attempts to acquire the next image from the swapchain. This image will be the target for rendering this frame.
 *   - If the swapchain is out of date (e.g., due to a window resize), this function internally calls `_SituationVulkanRecreateSwapchain` to handle the recreation process. In this specific case, it returns `false` to signal that the frame setup was interrupted and should be retried.
 *   - Resets the fence associated with the current frame index to the unsignaled state.
 *   - Resets the primary command buffer for the current frame.
 *   - Begins recording commands into the primary command buffer.
 *
 * @return `true` if the frame was successfully prepared and rendering can proceed.
 *         This is the standard return value for both OpenGL and Vulkan under normal conditions.
 * @return `false` (Vulkan only) if the swapchain was out of date and was automatically recreated. The caller should typically call `SituationAcquireFrameCommandBuffer()` again in the next iteration of their main loop to proceed with the new swapchain.
 * @return `false` if the library is not initialized.
 * @return `false` (Vulkan) if acquiring the swapchain image fails for reasons other than `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR` or `VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR`.
 * @return `false` (Vulkan) if resetting or beginning the command buffer fails.
 *
 * @note It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that:
 *       1. The library is initialized before calling this function.
 *       2. This function is called once per frame, before any rendering commands.
 *       3. (Vulkan) The application loop handles the `false` return value correctly, especially when it indicates swapchain recreation.

 *         Note: In Vulkan, the Y axis origin is typically the top-left.
 *         In OpenGL, it's the bottom-left, but `glViewport` handles this.
 * @param width The width of the viewport/scissor (in pixels). Must be positive.
 * @param height The height of the viewport/scissor (in pixels). Must be positive.
 *
 * @note It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that:

 *
 * @details This function instructs the GPU to render the geometry defined by the provided `SituationMesh`. It requires that a graphics pipeline (shader, potentially state) has been previously bound using `SituationCmdBindPipeline`.
 *
 * @par Backend-Specific Behavior
 * - **OpenGL:** Binds the mesh's Vertex Array Object (VAO) using `glBindVertexArray`.
 *   The VAO encapsulates the vertex buffer, index buffer, and vertex attribute configurations. It then calls `glDrawElements` to render the indexed geometry.
 *   In debug builds (`NDEBUG` not defined), it validates the VAO ID using `glIsVertexArray` to catch potential errors early.
 * - **Vulkan:** Explicitly binds the mesh's `vertex_buffer` and `index_buffer` to the command buffer using `vkCmdBindVertexBuffers` and `vkCmdBindIndexBuffer`.
 *   It then records a `vkCmdDrawIndexed` command. This requires the command buffer to be in the recording state and a compatible graphics pipeline to be bound.
 *
 * @param cmd The command buffer into which the draw command will be recorded.
 *            In OpenGL, this parameter is typically ignored as it uses global state.
 * @param mesh The `SituationMesh` handle containing the geometry data (vertices, indices) to be drawn.
 *
 * @return SITUATION_SUCCESS on successful recording of the draw command.
 * @return SITUATION_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED if the library is not initialized.
 * @return SITUATION_ERROR_RESOURCE_INVALID if the mesh handle is invalid (e.g., `id` is 0) or if the mesh contains no indices (`index_count` is 0).
 * @return SITUATION_ERROR_INVALID_PARAM (OpenGL, Debug) if the mesh's VAO ID is not a valid OpenGL name.
 * @return SITUATION_ERROR_INVALID_PARAM (Vulkan) if the provided command buffer handle is invalid.
 * @return SITUATION_ERROR_OPENGL_GENERAL (OpenGL) if an OpenGL error occurs during the draw process (e.g., invalid VAO state, context issues).

 *       1. A compatible graphics pipeline is bound before calling this function.
 *       2. (Vulkan) The command buffer `cmd` is valid and in the recording state.

 * - **OpenGL:** Calls `glDeleteTextures` to delete the texture name. The OpenGL driver manages the underlying memory and GPU resource lifecycle.
 * - **Vulkan:** Waits for the device to be idle to ensure the texture is no longer in use. Then, it destroys the `VkSampler`, `VkImageView`, and uses `vmaDestroyImage` for the `VkImage` and `VmaAllocation`.
 *   Crucially, if a persistent descriptor set was allocated for this texture during creation, it is also freed back to the dedicated persistent descriptor pool.
 *   This function uses the internal `_SituationVulkanDestroyTexture` helper if available for centralized Vulkan cleanup logic.
 *
 * @param[in,out] texture A pointer to the `SituationTexture` handle to destroy.
 *                        The `texture->id` field will be set to 0 upon successful destruction. The contents of the struct pointed to by `texture` will be zeroed.
 *

/**
 * @brief Creates a general-purpose GPU data buffer for storing vertices, indices, uniforms (UBOs), or shader storage data (SSBOs).
 * @details This is the primary function for allocating memory on the GPU. It abstracts the backend-specific complexities, such as OpenGL's buffer storage mechanisms or Vulkan's staging buffer transfers, into a single, unified call.
 *          The `usage_flags` parameter is critical, as it provides a hint to the driver about how the buffer will be used, which heavily influences performance and memory placement.
 *
 * @par Backend-Specific Behavior & Performance
 * - **OpenGL:** Uses modern Direct State Access (`glCreateBuffers`, `glNamedBufferStorage`). Buffers intended for updates (e.g., UBOs, SSBOs) are automatically created with `GL_DYNAMIC_STORAGE_BIT` to allow modification via `SituationUpdateBuffer`.
 * - **Vulkan:** This function implements a high-performance workflow.
 *   - If `initial_data` is provided, it automatically creates a temporary staging buffer, copies the data to it, and then records a GPU command to transfer the data to a fast, device-local (`VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY`) final buffer.
 *   - If the buffer is created with `SITUATION_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER` or `SITUATION_BUFFER_USAGE_STORAGE_BUFFER`, it also **pre-allocates and caches a persistent `VkDescriptorSet`** within the `SituationBuffer` handle. This
 *     makes subsequent binding with `SituationCmdBindUniformBuffer` or `SituationCmdBindComputeBuffer` an extremely fast operation, avoiding runtime descriptor allocation overhead.
 *
 * @param size The total size of the buffer to allocate, in bytes. Must be greater than zero.
 * @param initial_data A pointer to the initial data to upload to the buffer. If `NULL`, the buffer is allocated, but its contents are undefined until written to.
 * @param usage_flags A bitmask of `SituationBufferUsageFlags` that tells the driver how the buffer will be used.
 *                    This is a critical performance hint. Flags can be combined using the bitwise OR operator (e.g., `SITUATION_BUFFER_USAGE_VERTEX_BUFFER | SITUATION_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC`).
 *
 * @return A `SituationBuffer` handle.
 *         - On success, the `id` member of the returned struct will be non-zero, and the handle is ready for use.
 *         - On failure, the `id` member will be 0. Use `SituationGetLastErrorMsg()` to get a detailed error description.
 *           Failure can occur due to invalid parameters, running out of GPU memory, or other API errors.
 *
 * @note The caller is **responsible** for destroying the buffer using `SituationDestroyBuffer()` to prevent GPU memory leaks.
 *
 * @warning Providing incorrect or overly broad `usage_flags` can lead to suboptimal performance. For example, creating a static vertex buffer without `SITUATION_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST` might prevent it from being updated efficiently later.
 * @warning This function is not thread-safe and must be called from the main thread that initialized the library.

 * @brief Creates a compute pipeline directly from GLSL source code provided as a C string in memory.
 *
 * @details This function compiles the provided GLSL compute shader source code into SPIR-V bytecode (if the shader compiler is enabled) and then creates the corresponding backend-specific compute pipeline object (e.g., OpenGL program, Vulkan pipeline).
 *          The resulting `SituationComputePipeline` handle can be used with `SituationCmdBindComputePipeline` and `SituationCmdDispatch` to execute compute work on the GPU.
 *
 * @param compute_shader_source A null-terminated string containing the GLSL compute shader source code. Must not be NULL.
 *
 * @return A `SituationComputePipeline` handle.
 *         - On **success**: The handle's `.id` member will be non-zero, and it can be used for binding and dispatching. The caller is responsible for destroying it using `SituationDestroyComputePipeline()` to prevent resource leaks.
 *         - On **failure**: The handle will be in an invalid state (`.id` == 0). A detailed error message can be retrieved using `SituationGetLastErrorMsg()`.
 *
 * @note This function requires the library to be initialized (`SituationInit()` must have been called successfully).
 * @note This function requires the `SITUATION_ENABLE_SHADER_COMPILER` define to be set during compilation for the Vulkan backend to work with GLSL source. For OpenGL, it depends on the internal handling of GLSL vs SPIR-V (as discussed in `_SituationCreateGLComputeProgram`).
 * @warning This function is not thread-safe and must be called from the main thread that initialized the library.
 *
 * @par Resource Tracking and Potential Leaks:
 * If this function succeeds (returns a handle with `.id != 0`), the underlying GPU resources are valid.
 * However, an internal CPU memory allocation for resource tracking might fail. In this rare case:
 * - A warning will be printed to `stderr` (e.g., "WARNING: Potential leak of Vulkan compute pipeline handle...").
 * - The valid GPU resource handle is still returned.
 * - It is the caller's **absolute responsibility** to call `SituationDestroyComputePipeline()` on the returned handle to prevent a GPU resource leak, as the library's automatic shutdown cleanup will not track this specific resource.

 * @brief Binds a GPU buffer (typically an SSBO) to a specific binding point within the currently bound compute pipeline.
 * @details Associates a `SituationBuffer` with a binding point declared in the GLSL compute shader code (e.g., `layout(set = ..., binding = X) buffer ...`). This allows the compute shader to access the buffer's data.
 *
 * @par Backend-Specific Behavior & Performance
 * - **OpenGL:** Calls `glBindBufferBase(GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER, binding, buffer.gl_buffer_id)`.
 *   This efficiently binds the buffer to the specified unit for use by the currently active compute program.
 * - **Vulkan:** This function implements a high-performance, persistent descriptor set model.
 *   When the `SituationBuffer` was created (via `SituationCreateBuffer`), the Vulkan backend internally allocated a `VkDescriptorSet` from a dedicated persistent pool and populated
 *   it with the buffer's `VkBuffer` handle. This function simply records a fast `vkCmdBindDescriptorSets` command using this pre-cached descriptor set.
 *   This approach avoids the significant CPU overhead of allocating and updating descriptor sets every frame, which is crucial for performance in Vulkan.
 *
 * @param cmd The command buffer into which the bind command will be recorded (Vulkan) or ignored (OpenGL).
 * @param binding The binding point index within the compute shader's descriptor set.
 *                In GLSL, this corresponds to the `binding = X` part of the layout qualifier.
 *                In Vulkan, this corresponds to the `dstBinding` used when the buffer's internal descriptor set was originally populated (typically 0 for a single buffer resource within its set).
 * @param buffer The `SituationBuffer` handle to bind. The buffer should have been created with usage flags indicating it will be used as a storage buffer (e.g., `SITUATION_BUFFER_USAGE_STORAGE_BUFFER`).

 * @details Executes the compute shader associated with the compute pipeline that was previously bound using `SituationCmdBindComputePipeline`. The number of work groups to be executed in each dimension (X, Y, Z) must be specified.
 *
 * @par Backend-Specific Behavior
 * - **OpenGL:** Calls `glDispatchCompute`. This function uses the currently active compute program (bound via `glUseProgram`).
 * - **Vulkan:** Records a `vkCmdDispatch` command into the provided command buffer.
 *   It requires that a compute pipeline has been previously bound to the command buffer using `vkCmdBindPipeline` with `VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_COMPUTE`.
 *   Any necessary descriptor sets (for SSBOs, textures, etc.) must also be bound prior to this call.
 *
 * @param cmd The command buffer into which the dispatch command will be recorded (Vulkan) or which provides context (OpenGL, though often unused).
 * @param group_count_x The number of local work groups to dispatch in the X dimension.
 * @param group_count_y The number of local work groups to dispatch in the Y dimension.
 * @param group_count_z The number of local work groups to dispatch in the Z dimension.
 *
 * @note It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that:
 *       1. A valid compute pipeline is bound before calling this function.
 *       2. All required resources (buffers, textures via descriptor sets/binds) are bound.
 *       3. Appropriate memory barriers (`SituationMemoryBarrier`) are used if synchronization is needed before or after the dispatch.
 *
 * @warning Calling this function without a bound compute pipeline will result in undefined behavior or a Vulkan validation error.

/**
 * @brief [INTERNAL] Win32 callback function for enumerating and collecting physical display information.
 * @details This function is the core of the display enumeration logic on the Windows platform. It is designed to be passed as a callback to the Win32 API function `EnumDisplayMonitors`.
 *          For each monitor detected by the operating system, Windows invokes this function, providing a handle to the monitor.
 *
 * @par Function Workflow
 *   For each monitor passed to it, this function performs the following steps:
 *   1.  **Get Detailed Info:** Uses `GetMonitorInfoExA` to retrieve the monitor's unique device name (e.g., `\\.\DISPLAY1`) and determine if it is the primary display.
 *   2.  **Match with GLFW:** It attempts to correlate the Win32 monitor handle with a `GLFWmonitor` handle by comparing their screen coordinates. This is crucial for bridging the gap between the low-level OS information and the GLFW context used for windowing.
 *   3.  **Query Current Mode:** It uses `EnumDisplaySettingsA` to get the monitor's current resolution, refresh rate, and color depth.
 *   4.  **Enumerate All Modes:** It repeatedly calls `EnumDisplaySettingsA` in a loop to build a comprehensive, de-duplicated list of all video modes supported by the display.
 *   5.  **Store Data:** All of this collected information is stored in the next available `SituationDisplayInfo` struct within the array provided via the `dwData` parameter.
 *
 * @param hMonitor A handle to the display monitor, provided by the Win32 API.
 * @param hdcMonitor A handle to a device context for the monitor (unused).
 * @param lprcMonitor A pointer to a rectangle specifying the monitor's display area (unused).
 * @param dwData A user-defined value passed from the `EnumDisplayMonitors` call. In this library, it is a pointer to a `_SituationMonitorEnumData` struct, which contains the destination array and state for the enumeration process.
 *
 * @return `TRUE` to continue the enumeration to the next monitor. `FALSE` would halt the process.
 *
 * @note This function is platform-specific to Windows and is only compiled on `_WIN32`.
 * @warning This is a low-level callback and is not part of the public API. It should never be called directly.
 *
 * @see _SituationCachePhysicalDisplays(), EnumDisplayMonitors()

/**
 * @brief Sets the video mode for a specific monitor or moves the window to it.
 *
 * @details This function serves two purposes depending on the `fullscreen` parameter:
 *          1. **Fullscreen Mode:** Attempts to set the physical monitor to the resolution and refresh rate specified in `mode` and sets the application window to exclusive fullscreen on that monitor.
 *             On Windows, this uses `ChangeDisplaySettingsExA` for low-level control. On other platforms, it relies on GLFW's video mode switching.
 *          2. **Windowed Mode:** Exits fullscreen, restores the monitor's default settings (if changed), and centers the window on the specified monitor. The `mode` parameter determines the size of the window content area.
 *
 * @param situation_monitor_id The internal ID of the target monitor (index in the cached display list).
 * @param mode A pointer to a `SituationDisplayMode` struct specifying the desired width, height, refresh rate, and color depth.
 * @param fullscreen `true` to enter exclusive fullscreen mode; `false` for windowed mode.
 *
 * @return `SITUATION_SUCCESS` on success.
 * @return `SITUATION_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED` if the library is not running.
 * @return `SITUATION_ERROR_INVALID_PARAM` if the monitor ID is out of range or `mode` is NULL.
 * @return `SITUATION_ERROR_DISPLAY_SET` if the OS failed to apply the requested video settings.
 *
 * @note On Windows, this function attempts to match the Win32 monitor handle with the GLFW monitor handle to ensure correct placement.
 * @warning Changing display modes can cause the screen to flicker or go black momentarily.

 *
 * @par Backend-Specific Behavior
 * - **OpenGL:** Creates a Framebuffer Object (FBO), a color texture attachment (`GL_TEXTURE_2D`), and a depth renderbuffer attachment (`GL_RENDERBUFFER`). The texture's filtering mode is set based on the `scaling_mode`.
 * - **Vulkan:** Creates a comprehensive set of resources: a `VkImage` with `VmaAllocation` for color, another for depth, a `VkImageView` for each, a dedicated `VkRenderPass`, a `VkFramebuffer` to connect them, and a `VkSampler` configured for the specified `scaling_mode`.
 *   **Critically, it also pre-allocates and caches a persistent `VkDescriptorSet`** within the returned handle. This makes compositing this display in Vulkan an extremely high-performance operation, as no descriptor sets need to be allocated or updated in the main render loop.
 *
 * @param resolution The internal resolution of the virtual display (e.g., {320.0f, 240.0f}).
 * @param frame_time_mult A multiplier for this display's internal clock, used for slow-motion or fast-forward effects.
 * @param z_order The rendering order during compositing. Lower numbers are drawn first (further back).
 * @param scaling_mode The desired scaling and filtering method for compositing.
 * @param blend_mode The desired blend mode for compositing.
 *
 * @return The integer ID (>= 0) of the newly created virtual display.
 * @return -1 if creation fails (e.g., limit reached, resource allocation failed). Check `SituationGetLastErrorMsg()` for details.
 *
 * @note The caller is **responsible** for destroying the virtual display using `SituationDestroyVirtualDisplay()` to prevent GPU memory leaks.

 *   - **Push Constants** with a layout matching the internal `PBRModelPushConstants` struct, containing the model matrix, base color factor, and metallic/roughness factors.
 *   - **Camera Data** from a previously bound UBO (e.g., at `SIT_UBO_BINDING_VIEW_DATA`).
 *
 * @param cmd The command buffer for the current frame.
 * @param model The `SituationModel` handle to draw. Must be a valid, loaded model.
 * @param transform The root model-to-world transformation matrix (position, rotation, scale) to apply to the entire model.

/**
 * @brief Destroys a graphics shader pipeline and frees all of its associated GPU and CPU resources.
 * @details This is the only correct way to release a shader created with `SituationLoadShader` or `SituationLoadShaderFromMemory`. It handles the full cleanup process:
 *          1. Removes the shader from the internal resource tracking list to prevent false leak warnings at shutdown.
 *          2. Destroys all backend-specific GPU objects (OpenGL program, Vulkan pipeline and layout).
 *          3. Frees any associated CPU-side resources (like the OpenGL uniform location cache).
 *          4. Invalidates the user's handle by zeroing it out to prevent accidental use of stale data.
 *
 * @par Backend-Specific Behavior
 * - **OpenGL:** Destroys the internal uniform location cache (`_sit_uniform_map_destroy`), then deletes the shader program object (`glDeleteProgram`).
 * - **Vulkan:** Waits for the GPU to become idle to ensure the pipeline is not in use, then destroys both the `VkPipeline` and its associated `VkPipelineLayout`.
 *
 * @param[in,out] shader A pointer to the `SituationShader` handle to be destroyed. The contents of the struct will be zeroed out, invalidating the handle for future use.
 *
 * @note It is safe to call this function on a NULL pointer or an already-unloaded shader handle (where `shader->id` is 0); it will simply do nothing.
 * @warning This function can cause a GPU stall on the Vulkan backend due to `vkDeviceWaitIdle`.
 *          Avoid unloading shaders frequently in performance-critical loops.

/**
 * @brief Sets the value of a standalone uniform variable within a graphics shader program.
 * @details This function provides a convenient way to pass data to shaders, primarily for the OpenGL backend where standalone uniforms are common. It automatically caches uniform locations for high performance on subsequent calls.
 *
 * @par Backend-Specific Behavior & Usage
 * - **OpenGL:** This is the primary, high-performance method for setting per-draw-call data that is not part of a larger UBO.
 *      On the first call for a given `uniform_name`, it queries the uniform's location using `glGetUniformLocation` and caches it in an internal hash map. Subsequent calls for the same uniform are extremely fast as they use the cached location, avoiding repeated string lookups.
 *      It uses the appropriate `glUniform*` function based on the provided `type`.
 *
 * - **Vulkan:** This function is **not recommended** for the Vulkan backend and will return `SITUATION_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.
 *      Vulkan's architecture is optimized for passing data via Uniform Buffer Objects (UBOs) for per-frame data and **Push Constants** for small, high-frequency per-draw data. For Vulkan, you should use `SituationCmdBindUniformBuffer` and `SituationCmdSetPushConstant` instead.
 *
 * @param shader The `SituationShader` handle whose uniform you want to set.
 * @param uniform_name The null-terminated string name of the uniform variable in the GLSL code (e.g., "u_modelMatrix").
 * @param data A pointer to the data to be sent to the uniform (e.g., a `mat4`, `vec4`, `float`).
 * @param type An enum `SituationUniformType` that specifies the data type of the uniform. This determines which underlying API function is called.
 *
 * @return `SITUATION_SUCCESS` on success.
 * @return `SITUATION_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED` if the library is not initialized.
 * @return `SITUATION_ERROR_INVALID_PARAM` if any of the input parameters are invalid.
 * @return `SITUATION_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` if called on the Vulkan backend.
 * @return `SITUATION_ERROR_OPENGL_GENERAL` if an OpenGL error occurs.
 *
 * @note In OpenGL, if the specified `uniform_name` does not exist in the shader or is optimized out by the compiler, this function will silently do nothing and return `SITUATION_SUCCESS`. This is standard behavior for `glGetUniformLocation`.

 * @par Boundary Handling
 *   Like `SituationImageDraw`, this function is robust against invalid coordinates and will only draw the overlapping area between the source and destination rectangles, preventing out-of-bounds memory access.
 *
 * @param[in,out] dst A pointer to the destination `SituationImage` to be modified.
 * @param src The source `SituationImage` to draw from.
 * @param srcRect The rectangular region within the source image to use.
 * @param dstPos The top-left `(x, y)` position on the destination image where drawing should start.
 * @param tint The color to modulate the source image with as it's drawn. White `{255,255,255,255}` results in no color change.

/**
 * @brief Draws a single character (codepoint) onto a SituationImage with advanced styling.
 * @details This is a powerful, low-level function for high-quality text rendering. It can render a single character with fill, outline, rotation, and horizontal skew.
 *
 * @par Rendering Method
 *   - **With Outline:** Uses a high-quality Signed Distance Field (SDF) method to render smooth, scalable outlines of a precise thickness.
 *   - **Without Outline:** Uses a simpler, faster anti-aliased bitmap rendering path.
 *   - **With Transformations:** For rotation or skew, it uses an inverse mapping algorithm with bilinear filtering to sample the glyph, ensuring smooth, high-quality results without aliasing ("jaggies").
 *
 * @param[in,out] dst A pointer to the destination `SituationImage` to draw on.
 * @param font The `SituationFont` to use for rendering.
 * @param codepoint The Unicode codepoint of the character to draw.
 * @param position The top-left position for the character's baseline.
 * @param fontSize The desired font size in pixels.
 * @param rotationDegrees The rotation of the character in degrees, pivoting around its baseline start. Positive values rotate counter-clockwise.
 * @param skewFactor A factor for horizontal shearing. `0.0` is no skew. `0.5` will skew the top of the character 50% of its height to the right.
 * @param fillColor The color for the character's interior.
 * @param outlineColor The color for the character's outline.
 * @param outlineThickness The thickness of the outline in pixels. A value of `0.0f` or less disables the outline and uses the faster non-SDF rendering path.
 *
 * @note This function is the building block for `SituationImageDrawTextEx`. It is generally more convenient to use the higher-level functions unless you need to control the placement and rendering of each character individually.

 * @param fontSize The desired font size in pixels.
 * @param spacing Additional spacing between characters in pixels, applied along the text's baseline.
 * @param rotationDegrees The rotation of the entire text block in degrees. `0` is no rotation. Positive values rotate counter-clockwise.

/**
 * @brief Draws simple, tinted text onto an image using a basic bitmap-compositing approach.
 * @details This function serves as the classic, straightforward method for rendering text. For each character in the input string, it performs the following steps:
 *          1. Generates a 1-channel (alpha-only) bitmap of the character using stb_truetype.
 *          2. Creates a temporary 4-channel (RGBA) `SituationImage` in memory to hold the glyph.
 *          3. Copies the 1-channel bitmap into the alpha channel of the temporary image.
 *          4. Calls the general-purpose `SituationImageDrawAlpha` function to composite this temporary glyph image onto the destination, applying the requested tint color.
 *          5. Frees the memory for the temporary glyph image.
 * @section Relationship to SituationImageDrawTextEx
 *   This function is **intentionally separate** from `SituationImageDrawTextEx` and does not call it.
 *   They use fundamentally different rendering techniques for different use cases:
 *   - **SituationImageDrawText (this function):** Uses `stbtt_MakeCodepointBitmap`. It is optimized for simplicity and is perfect for rendering basic, aliased, solid-color text. It cannot produce outlines.
 *   - **SituationImageDrawTextEx:** Uses a more complex Signed Distance Field (SDF) rendering path via the internal `SituationImageDrawCodepoint` function. This path is required to render high-quality, anti-aliased outlines of a specified thickness, but has a slightly higher initial processing cost.
 *   By keeping them separate, the library provides two distinct tools: a simple one for basic needs and an advanced one for stylistic text.
 * @note **Performance Considerations:** Because this function allocates and frees a temporary image for every single character drawn, it is not recommended for text that needs to be redrawn every frame (e.g., a rapidly changing score counter).
 *       For performance-critical text, it is best to pre-render the required characters to a single font atlas image and then use `SituationImageDrawAlpha` to blit the characters from the atlas.
 * @param dst The destination image to be modified.
 * @param font The `SituationFont` to use for rendering the characters.
 * @param text The null-terminated string to be drawn.
 * @param position The top-left position on the destination image for the baseline of the first character.
 * @param fontSize The height of the font in pixels.
 * @param spacing Additional horizontal space to add between each character.
 * @param tint The color to apply to the text. The text will be rendered in this color.

 * 3. **Custom Processor Chain:** The data is then passed through any user-attached DSP processors, allowing for custom, real-time effects like bitcrushing or flangers.
 * 4. **Final Conversion & Mixing:** The fully processed audio is then:
 *    - Resampled to apply pitch shifting and match the device's sample rate.
 *    - Converted to the device's native format (e.g., S16, F32).

 *   - Spend 0.25 seconds in state 0.
 *   - Flip to state 1 and spend 0.25 seconds in state 1.
 *   - Flip back to state 0 and spend 0.25 seconds in state 0.

 *   - This function, `SituationTimerGetPingProgress`, simply measures the time elapsed since that last reset and divides it by the oscillator's `period` to get a normalized progress value.
 *
 * @par Return Value
 *   - **`0.0`** means the timer has just been successfully pinged (reset).
 *   - **`0.5`** means half of the interval duration has elapsed.
 *   - **`1.0`** means the full interval duration has elapsed, and a call to `SituationTimerPingOscillator` would now return `true`.
 *   - **`> 1.0`** means more than one full interval has elapsed since the last ping.
 *
 * @param oscillator_id The ID of the oscillator (0-255) whose `period` will be used as the duration for the interval.
 *

 *
 * @par Backend-Specific Behavior
 * - **OpenGL:** Uses `glReadPixels` to read from the default framebuffer. The resulting image is vertically flipped, so the function automatically calls `SituationImageFlip` to correct the orientation.
 * - **Vulkan:** Performs a synchronized copy from the device-local swapchain image to a temporary, host-visible staging buffer. This is a complex operation involving command buffer submission and waiting for the GPU to complete the transfer, managed by the internal `_SituationVulkanBlitImageToHostVisibleBuffer` helper. The resulting image is correctly oriented.
 *
 * @warning This function allocates new memory for the `image.data`. The caller is **responsible** for freeing this memory by calling `SituationUnloadImage()` on the returned `SituationImage`. Failure to do so will result in a memory leak.
 * @warning This can be a slow operation, as it requires synchronization with the GPU and a potentially large data transfer from VRAM to system RAM. Avoid calling it in performance-critical loops.
