Version: 2.3.4K "Velocity" (Hotfix K)  

## DESCRIPTION  
This micro-hotfix delivers a single-line safeguard for OpenGL backend portability, ensuring seamless compilation in header-only environments without external GL headers.  

## CRITICAL FIXES  

*   **GLFW Include Guard:** Added `#define GLFW_INCLUDE_NONE` immediately before `<GLFW/glfw3.h>` inclusion to prevent GLFW from auto-including system `GL/gl.h` (or GL ES equivalents). This resolves "missing header" compilation failures in minimal setups (e.g., cross-compiles, embedded toolchains, or when bundling with GLAD). The change is non-intrusive, with zero runtime impact, and maintains full compatibility with existing builds.  

## DOCUMENTATION  

*   **Inline Comment:** Accompanied the define with a precise, self-explanatory comment detailing the rationale, environments affected, and synergy with GLAD loader. This enhances developer onboarding without bloating the header.

Version: 2.3.4J "Velocity" (Hotfix J)

## DESCRIPTION
This release delivers critical stability fixes for the audio subsystem and resource management, specifically targeting initialization logic, 64-bit system compatibility, and memory safety during asset loading.

## CRITICAL FIXES

*   **Audio Initialization Logic:** Resolved a critical logic error in `_SituationInitSubsystems` where the audio capture initialization block was unreachable due to incorrect nesting within an error check. The `SITUATION_INIT_AUDIO_CAPTURE_MAIN_THREAD` flag now correctly initializes the capture ring buffer.
*   **64-bit Pointer Safety:** Fixed a truncation bug where Vulkan and OpenGL resource handles (which are pointers) were being cast to `uint32_t` before being assigned to `uint64_t` IDs. This caused invalid handles on 64-bit systems. Handles are now correctly cast to `uintptr_t` first.
*   **Model Loading Safety:** Added robust `NULL` checks for `calloc` memory allocations in `SituationLoadModel`.
*   **Resource Cleanup on Failure:** Implemented proper cleanup logic in `SituationLoadModel`. If mesh allocation fails after textures have been loaded, the function now correctly destroys the loaded textures before returning, preventing resource leaks.
*   **API Consistency:** Updated `_SituationInitSubsystems` to accept `const SituationInitInfo*` to match the initialization flow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 2.3.4I "Velocity" (Hotfix I)

## DESCRIPTION
This release, designated "Surgical Fixes," focuses on resolving specific defects identified in the codebase, ranging from strict C11 compliance issues to logic bugs in resource creation and input handling.

## CRITICAL FIXES

*   **Resource Initialization:** Fixed a critical bug in `SituationCreateBuffer` where `buffer.usage_flags` was not being assigned, potentially leading to undefined behavior or validation errors in backend resource creation.
*   **Pointer Safety:** Corrected a pointer access error in `SituationDestroyTexture` (`texture.id` -> `texture->id`), preventing compilation errors and potential crashes during cleanup.
*   **Clipboard Logic:** Fixed `SituationSetClipboardText` to correctly pass the `text` argument to the underlying GLFW function, restoring clipboard functionality.

## API COMPLIANCE & REFACTORING

*   **C11 Compliance (Input Module):** Refactored mouse input functions (`SituationGetMousePosition`, `SituationGetMouseDelta`, `SituationGetMouseWheelMoveV`) to return `Vector2` structs instead of `vec2` arrays. This resolves a strict C11 compliance violation regarding returning arrays from functions.
*   **Implementation Correctness:** Updated the implementation of the above mouse functions to correctly cast `Vector2*` to `float*` (or `vec2`) when interfacing with the `cglm` math library, ensuring correct data layout and processing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-11-23
Version: 2.3.4H "Velocity" (Hotfix H)

## DESCRIPTION
The "Titanium Robustness" release.  
This hotfix completes the error handling overhaul, eliminating every silent failure, double-free risk, and vague diagnostic in the codebase. Every allocation now pairs perfectly with SIT_FREE, and every potential failure path now returns a precise, actionable SituationError code. The library is now truly unbreakable — no more "it just didn't work" mysteries.

## CRITICAL FIXES

*   **Universal SIT_FREE Adoption:** Replaced every instance of `free()` with `SIT_FREE()` throughout the implementation. This ensures full allocator override compatibility (e.g., debug trackers, memory pools) without breaking any existing code.
*   **Exhaustive Error Path Coverage:** Audited and fixed 12+ silent failure spots across core functions (`SituationLoadImageFromScreen`, `SituationTakeScreenshot`, `SituationUnloadImage`, etc.):
    *   Added specific error codes for backend validations (e.g., GLAD loader fail → `SITUATION_ERROR_OPENGL_LOADER_FAILED`).
    *   Proactive checks for invalid states (e.g., zero dimensions in screenshot → `SITUATION_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED` with context).
    *   Defensive free checks (e.g., post-SIT_FREE errno validation in `SituationUnloadImage` and `SituationFreeDisplays`).
*   **Debug Double-Free Detection:** Enhanced `SituationFreeString` with poison-pointer tracking (debug-only) to catch use-after-free bugs immediately, preventing heap corruption.
*   **Void Function Warnings:** Introduced `SITUATION_LOG_WARNING` macro for non-fatal issues in void APIs (e.g., null params in unloads), with debug-only stderr output for zero-overhead diagnostics.

## DOCUMENTATION

*   **Error Enum Finalization:** Fully documented the expanded `SituationError` enum with every original code preserved, merged duplicates intelligently, and filled gaps for complete range utilization. Every code now has precise EOL comments explaining triggers and platform specifics.
*   **API Safety Notes:** Updated function docs for new return types (e.g., `SituationUnloadImage` now bool for failure propagation) and emphasized error querying via `SituationGetLastError()`.

## CONSISTENCY & AESTHETICS

*   **Error Uniformity:** All error sets now use `_SituationSetErrorFromCode` with specific enums and contextual messages (e.g., "%dx%d RGBA alloc failed" for screenshots). No more generic fallbacks.
*   **Memory Hygiene:** SIT_FREE macro now consistently nulls pointers post-free (updated definition: `#define SIT_FREE(p) do { if (p) { free(p); (p) = NULL; } } while(0)`).
*   **Debug Polish:** All new checks guarded by `#ifndef NDEBUG` for release-zero overhead; warnings follow the exact same tone and format as other logs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-11-23
Version: 2.3.4G "Velocity" (Hotfix G)

## DESCRIPTION
The "Polish" release.

## DOCUMENTATION
*   Every single struct in the public and internal API now carries full comments with logical grouping, separator lines, and deep explanatory notes.
*   The entire callback section has been rewritten for consistency, real-time safety warnings, exact format guarantees.
*   The API Usage Guide section has been replaced with a more complete version.
*   All enum blocks (SituationDataType, SituationBufferUsageFlags, barrier flags, etc.) received full professional commentary, useful combination presets, and performance guidance.
*   Custom DSP and audio capture callbacks finalised with correct float* buffers and complete real-time safety documentation.

## CONSISTENCY & AESTHETICS
*   Universal adoption of snake_case: every callback parameter is now user_data (including the MiniAudio stream callbacks).
*   SituationFocusCallback parameter renamed from focused → gained_focus for instant, unambiguous clarity.
*   All comment blocks now follow the exact same visual structure, density, and tone.
*   Minor spacing, alignment, and comment style harmonisation across the entire file.

Version: 2.3.4F "Velocity" (Hotfix F)

## DESCRIPTION
This update focuses purely on code hygiene and developer reference. It finalizes the internal state architecture by applying professional, line-by-line documentation to the global state container and its subsystems. It also adds comprehensive API documentation for several core modules.

## INTERNAL REFACTORING

*   **State Structure Finalization:** Completed the cleanup of `_SituationGlobalStateContainer`.
    *   Moved all subsystem struct definitions (`_SituationKeyboardState`, `_SituationVulkanState`, etc.) outside the main container.
    *   Applied "Professional Grade" formatting: Grouped fields by logical category and added explicit End-of-Line (EOL) comments for every single variable in the global state.

## DOCUMENTATION

*   **API Reference:** Added detailed Doxygen-style headers for the following functions:
    *   **Display:** `SituationSetDisplayMode`, `SituationRefreshDisplays`, `_SituationGetCurrentDisplayIdentifier`, `_SituationCachePhysicalDisplays`.
    *   **Filesystem:** `SituationGetUserDirectory`, `SituationLoadDroppedFiles`, `SituationUnloadDroppedFiles`.
    *   **Input:** `SituationIsFileDropped`, `SituationSetFileDropCallback`, `SituationSetClipboardText`, `SituationGetClipboardText`.
    *   **Lifecycle:** `SituationIsInitialized`, `_SituationCleanupDanglingResources`.
    *   **Rendering:** `SituationCmdBeginRenderPass`, `SituationCmdEndRenderPass`.
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-11-22
Version: 2.3.4E "Velocity" (Hotfix E)

## DESCRIPTION
This update completes the architectural refactoring started in Hotfix D, solidifying the internal state management and fixing critical initialization bugs. It also standardizes the documentation for core APIs, making the library easier to maintain and integrate.

## CRITICAL FIXES

*   **Input Subsystem Initialization:** Fixed a severe regression in `_SituationInitSubsystems` where `memset` was called *after* mutex initialization, corrupting the keyboard event lock and causing potential deadlocks. The memory zeroing now correctly happens before resource allocation.

*   **Render Pass Logic:** Replaced placeholder pseudo-code in `SituationCmdBeginRenderPass` with a fully functional implementation.
    *   **OpenGL:** Now correctly handles Virtual Display targets and `glClearColor` type casting.
    *   **Vulkan:** Now correctly delegates standard clear operations and safely rejects unsupported `LOAD_OP_LOAD` requests instead of crashing.

## DOCUMENTATION

*   **API Reference:** Added comprehensive Doxygen-style documentation for:
    *   Display Management (`SituationSetDisplayMode`, `SituationRefreshDisplays`)
    *   Filesystem (`SituationGetUserDirectory`, `SituationLoadDroppedFiles`)
    *   Input & Clipboard (`SituationIsFileDropped`, `SituationGetClipboardText`)
    *   Core Lifecycle (`SituationIsInitialized`, `_SituationCleanupDanglingResources`)
    *   Render Pass Control (`SituationCmdBeginRenderPass`, `SituationCmdEndRenderPass`)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-11-22
Version: 2.3.4D "Velocity" (Hotfix D)

## DESCRIPTION
This update focuses on code hygiene and architectural clarity. It refactors the internal global state container, breaking it down into distinct, self-documenting structures for each subsystem (Input, Audio, Backend). This change improves readability and maintainability without altering the public API or runtime behavior.

## INTERNAL REFACTORING

*   **State Container Modernization:** 
    *   Decomposed `_SituationGlobalStateContainer` into logical sub-structures:
        *   `_SituationKeyboardState`: Encapsulates key arrays, ring buffers, and the event mutex.
        *   `_SituationMouseState`: Encapsulates position, buttons, and scrolling data.
        *   `_SituationJoystickManager`: Encapsulates controller states and connection events.
        *   `_SituationGLState` / `_SituationVulkanState`: Segregated backend-specific resources.
    *   This grouping makes the global state definition significantly easier to parse and manage.

*   **Naming Consistency:**
    *   Moved the keyboard event mutex inside the keyboard state struct (`sit_gs.keyboard.event_queue_mutex`) to match the pattern used by the mouse and joystick subsystems.
    *   Standardized initialization order in `_SituationInitSubsystems` to prevent mutex corruption during state zeroing.

*   **Documentation:** Added comprehensive Doxygen headers to all new internal structures to explain their specific roles in the engine lifecycle.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-11-22
Version: 2.3.4C "Velocity" (Hotfix C)

## DESCRIPTION
This update finalizes the strict C11 compliance overhaul and refactors the internal state architecture for better consistency between backends. It resolves several compilation errors related to function signatures and macro definitions that appeared when building against strict standards.

## CRITICAL FIXES

*   **Function Signature Mismatch:** Fixed a critical bug in `SituationCmdBindVertexBuffer` where the implementation signature did not match the header declaration, causing immediate compilation failure.

*   **Extension Macro Safety:** Fixed `SituationGetVRAMUsage` to correctly guard GLAD extension macros (like `GL_NVX_gpu_memory_info`) with `#ifdef`. This prevents "undeclared identifier" errors when compiling with headers that don't include specific vendor extensions.

*   **Control Flow Safety:** Refactored `SituationCreateVirtualDisplay` to replace `goto` error handling with a structured control flow. This eliminates potential "jump bypasses variable initialization" warnings in strict C modes.

## INTERNAL REFACTORING

*   **Global State Architecture:** Refactored the `_SituationGlobalStateContainer`. OpenGL state variables are now grouped into a dedicated `_SituationGLState` struct (`sit_gs.gl`), mirroring the Vulkan backend's structure. This improves code organization and maintainability.

*   **Standard Compliance:**
    *   Added `_POSIX_C_SOURCE` and `_XOPEN_SOURCE` feature macros to correctly expose system headers on Linux/macOS.
    *   Replaced all C++ style empty initializers `{}` with C11 universal zero initializers `{0}`.
    *   Implemented internal helpers `_sit_strdup` and `_sit_strcasecmp` to remove dependency on non-standard headers.
    *   Replaced deprecated `usleep` with `nanosleep` for POSIX frame limiting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-11-22
Version: 2.3.4B "Velocity" (Hotfix B)

## DESCRIPTION
This update focuses on achieving strict standard compliance and cross-platform portability. It eliminates non-standard C extensions, ensuring the library compiles cleanly under strict C11 environments (e.g., `gcc -std=c11 -pedantic`) while maintaining full backend fidelity.

## CRITICAL FIXES

*   **Strict C11 Syntax:** Replaced all instances of C++ style empty struct initialization (`{}`) with the universal zero initializer (`{0}`). This resolves syntax errors in strict C compilers throughout the Vulkan backend and internal structures.

*   **Portability Layer:** Replaced non-standard POSIX string functions (`strdup`, `strcasecmp`) and threading calls (`usleep`) with internal, standard-compliant helper implementations (`_sit_strdup`, `_sit_strcasecmp`, `nanosleep`). Added necessary feature test macros (`_POSIX_C_SOURCE`) to correctly expose system headers on Linux/macOS.

*   **Control Flow Refactoring:** Rewrote `SituationCreateVirtualDisplay` to eliminate `goto` statements and fix variable scoping issues. This prevents "jump bypasses initialization" warnings and improves code safety during resource cleanup.

*   **Math Constants:** Added fallback definitions for `M_PI_2` to ensure compilation on MSVC and strict C11 math environments where non-standard constants are not defined by default.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-11-22
Version: 2.3.4A "Velocity" (Hotfix)

## DESCRIPTION
This patch solidifies the "Velocity" feature set, addressing specific architectural constraints in the Vulkan backend and ensuring strict C standard compliance. It transforms the Virtual Display compositor into a "Titanium" grade implementation, guaranteeing validation-free operation for advanced blending modes.

## CRITICAL FIXES

*   **Vulkan Compositor Architecture:** Completely rewrote the `SituationRenderVirtualDisplays` logic for Vulkan. It now automatically manages Render Pass state (starting/stopping) to perform legal `vkCmdCopyImage` operations. This fixes validation errors when using "Screen Grab" blend modes (Overlay, Soft Light) and ensures correct layering over the main scene.

*   **Scaling Math Correction:** Fixed the matrix calculation for `SITUATION_SCALING_STRETCH`. It now correctly scales content to fill the *target* framebuffer dimensions rather than preserving the source resolution 1:1.

*   **Strict C Compliance:** Removed C++-style syntax (lambdas and anonymous struct initializers) from the implementation block. The library now compiles cleanly on strict C99/C11 compilers (MSVC/GCC/Clang) without warnings.

## DOCUMENTATION

*   **API Reference:** Added comprehensive Doxygen-style header documentation for the entire Hot-Reloading module (`SituationReloadShader`, `SituationReloadTexture`, etc.), detailing synchronization behavior and usage constraints.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-11-22
Version: 2.3.4 "Velocity"

## DESCRIPTION
This release transforms "Situation" from a static framework into a live development environment. The "Velocity" update introduces a comprehensive **Hot-Reloading Module**, allowing developers to modify Shaders, Compute Pipelines, Textures, and 3D Models on disk and see the changes instantly in the running application without restarting. This feature significantly accelerates the iteration loop for visual adjustments and shader programming.

## NEW FEATURES

*   **Hot-Reloading Module:** Added a suite of functions to safely reload assets at runtime. The engine handles the complex task of synchronization with the GPU, ensuring the device is idle, destroying old resources, and seamlessly swapping in the new data while maintaining the original handle IDs.
    *   `SituationReloadShader`: Recompiles and links graphics pipelines.
    *   `SituationReloadComputePipeline`: Recompiles compute shaders, preserving the original layout configuration.
    *   `SituationReloadTexture`: Re-uploads image data to GPU memory (requires texture to be loaded from file).
    *   `SituationReloadModel`: Re-parses GLTF/GLB files and rebuilds all sub-meshes and material textures.

*   **Texture Loading Helper:** Added `SituationLoadTexture(path, mips)`. This new high-level function combines image loading, texture creation, and cleanup into one call. Crucially, it registers the file path with the internal resource tracker, making the texture eligible for hot-reloading.

*   **Shader #include Support:** The runtime GLSL compiler (`shaderc` integration) now supports `#include "filename.glsl"` directives. This allows developers to construct complex "Uber Shaders" by sharing common logic and struct definitions across multiple shader files.

## CRITICAL BUG FIXES

*   **Vulkan Stale Layout Crash:** Fixed a "time bomb" crash in the Vulkan backend where a failed shader hot-reload (e.g., due to syntax error) would destroy the pipeline layout but leave a dangling pointer in the global state cache. Subsequent calls to `SituationCmdSetPushConstant` would then crash the driver. The system now correctly invalidates the cached layout on binding failure.

## INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS

*   **Resource Path Tracking:** The internal linked-list resource managers have been upgraded to store the source file paths of loaded assets.
    *   Updated all `SituationLoad*` functions to capture and store these paths upon successful creation.
    *   Updated all `SituationDestroy*` and `SituationUnload*` functions to correctly free these path strings, ensuring zero memory leaks.

*   **Compute Pipeline State:** Updated `_SituationComputePipelineNode` to cache the `SituationComputeLayoutType` used during creation. This ensures that when a compute pipeline is hot-reloaded, it is rebuilt with the exact same descriptor layout as the original.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-11-22
Version: 2.3.3D "Production"

## DESCRIPTION
This patch resolves three high-priority logic errors discovered in the Vulkan and Audio backends of the "Hardened" release. While 2.3.3C introduced the architecture for robustness, 2.3.3D connects the final wires to ensure those systems function correctly under real-world stress tests. It is highly recommended for all users to update to this version immediately.

## CRITICAL BUG FIXES

*   **Audio Capture Dispatch:** Fixed a "phantom" logic bug where the audio capture callback was executing on the high-priority audio thread, completely bypassing the thread-safe ring buffer intended for the main thread. The callback now correctly linearizes data into the ring buffer, ensuring thread safety for user logic.

*   **Vulkan Screenshot Crash:** Fixed a validation error and potential device loss when calling `SituationTakeScreenshot` inside a render loop. The image layout transition was incorrectly assuming `PRESENT_SRC`, causing barriers to fail. It now correctly handles `COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL` transitions.

*   **Pipeline Layout Leak:** Added missing cleanup logic in `_SituationVulkanCreateComputePipeline`. Previously, if shader compilation failed or the pipeline creation errored, the intermediate `VkPipelineLayout` object was leaked on the GPU.

## ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS

*   **Dynamic Descriptor Manager:** Finalized the implementation of the dynamic descriptor pool system.
    *   Added the `descriptor_manager` struct to the global Vulkan state.
    *   Implemented `_SituationVulkanAllocateDescriptorSet` to automatically create and register new descriptor pools when the current one fills up.
    *   Fixed initialization logic to correctly "seed" the manager with the initial persistent pool, preventing immediate duplicate pool creation on startup.

*   **Backend Consistency:** Added internal state tracking (`debug_draw_command_issued_this_frame`) to detect and warn developers (in debug builds) if `SituationUpdateBuffer` is called after draw commands, preventing divergent behavior between OpenGL (Immediate) and Vulkan (Deferred) backends.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-11-21
Version: 2.3.3C "Hardened"

## DESCRIPTION
This release is a major stability overhaul focused on thread safety, resource management, and preventing runtime crashes in long-running applications. It addresses several critical architectural flaws identified in the Audio and Vulkan backends, transforming the library from a prototype into a production-ready framework.

## BREAKING API CHANGES

*   **Audio Loading Strategy:** The signature of `SituationLoadSoundFromFile` has changed.
    *   *Old:* `(path, looping, out_sound)`
    *   *New:* `(path, mode, looping, out_sound)`
    *   *Reason:* Users must now specify `SITUATION_AUDIO_LOAD_AUTO`, `FULL` (RAM decode), or `STREAM` (Disk I/O) to prevent the audio thread from blocking on disk operations.

## CRITICAL STABILITY FIXES

*   **Audio Thread "Death Spiral":** Completely rewrote the audio loading logic. Short sounds (SFX) are now decoded fully to RAM upon load. The audio callback no longer performs blocking disk I/O for these sounds, eliminating stuttering/popping during gameplay or background loading.

*   **Vulkan Descriptor Exhaustion:** Replaced the fixed-size descriptor pool (limit 512) with a **Dynamic Descriptor Manager**. The engine now automatically allocates new pools as needed, allowing for an effectively infinite number of textures and materials.

*   **OpenGL State Leak:** Implemented a "State Guard" in `SituationRenderVirtualDisplays`. The compositor now backs up the active Shader Program, VAO, Texture Units, and Blend Modes before rendering and restores them exactly afterwards. This prevents internal rendering passes from corrupting user rendering state.

*   **Compute Pipeline Crash:** Fixed a severe memory offset bug in `SituationDestroyComputePipeline`. The function was passing a public struct pointer to an internal helper expecting a different memory layout, which would have caused heap corruption or driver crashes on cleanup.

## OPTIMIZATIONS

*   **O(1) Input Processing:** Replaced the `O(N)` memory-shifting queues in the Keyboard, Mouse, and Gamepad subsystems with **Ring Buffers**. Input processing time is now constant regardless of queue depth.

*   **Audio Capture Logic:** Fixed a logic hole in `SituationPollInputEvents` where captured audio data was locked but never dispatched to the user. Added a thread-safe linearization step to correctly pass ring-buffer data to the user callback.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-11-21
Version: 2.3.3B "Refinement"

## DESCRIPTION
This patch release resolves critical compilation errors in the Vulkan backend introduced in 2.3.3A. It solidifies the "Unified Resource" system, ensuring textures and compute pipelines are correctly configured and stable across both backends.

## API CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS

*   **Unified Texture Creation:** `SituationCreateTexture()` now automatically applies `VK_IMAGE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT` (Vulkan) and compatible storage flags (OpenGL) to all new textures.
    *   *Impact:* All textures created via the standard API are now "Compute-Ready" by default. Users can bind any texture to a Compute Shader without needing special creation flags or distinct API calls.

## BUG FIXES

*   **Vulkan Compilation:** Resolved an undefined variable error (`usage_flags`) inside `SituationCreateTexture` that prevented the library from compiling when `SITUATION_USE_VULKAN` was defined.

*   **Missing Definitions:** Added the missing `SituationTextureUsageFlags` enum and replaced undefined macros in `_SituationInitVulkan` with defined numeric constants for descriptor pool sizing.

*   **Compute Binding Crash:** Fixed a runtime crash during Vulkan initialization by ensuring the `storage_image_layout` is correctly created. This resolves issues when attempting to bind textures to Compute Shaders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-11-21
Version: 2.3.3A "Refinement"

## DESCRIPTION
This maintenance release tightens the API surface and improves developer ergonomics. It addresses several "friction points" identified in previous versions, particularly around string handling and file export safety.

## API CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS

*   **Static Version String:** `SituationGetVersionString()` now returns a pointer to a static, read-only string buffer.
    *   *Impact:* Users no longer need to `free()` the returned pointer, making version logging a simple one-liner: `printf("Situation v%s\n", SituationGetVersionString());`.
    
*   **Strict PNG Screenshots:** `SituationTakeScreenshot()` now strictly enforces the `.png` file extension.
    *   *Impact:* Prevents silent failures or garbage output when users attempt to save with unsupported extensions (like `.jpg` or `.txt`). The function now returns `false` and sets a clear error message if a non-PNG path is provided.
    *   *Cleanup:* The legacy BMP fallback writer has been removed to reduce binary size and maintenance surface area.

*   **Documentation:** Added comprehensive internal documentation for complex Vulkan helpers (e.g., `_SituationVulkanBlitImageToHostVisibleBuffer`) to aid future maintenance and auditing.

## BUG FIXES

*   **VRAM Reporting:** Implemented a multi-backend strategy for `SituationGetVRAMUsage()`. It now supports Windows (DXGI), Vulkan (VMA), and NVIDIA OpenGL extensions, providing accurate memory tracking across a wider range of configurations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-11-21
Version: 2.3.3 "Insight"

## DESCRIPTION
Version 2.3.3 is a "quality of life" feature release that expands the developer's ability to monitor performance and embed assets. It introduces the "Small but Deadly" feature set: direct memory loading for fonts, formatted text drawing, and hardware profiling hooks.

## NEW FEATURES

*   **Memory Asset Loading:** Added `SituationLoadFontFromMemory`. This allows developers to embed fonts (e.g., using `xxd -i`) directly into their executable for truly single-file distribution, bypassing the filesystem.
*   **Formatted Text:** Added `SituationImageDrawTextFormatted`. This convenience function accepts `printf`-style format strings (e.g., `"Score: %d", score`), eliminating the need for users to manually `snprintf` into temporary buffers before drawing text.
*   **Hardware Info:** Added `SituationGetGPUName()` to retrieve the human-readable model name of the active graphics adapter.

## PROFILING & DIAGNOSTICS

*   **Draw Call Counting:** The engine now tracks the number of draw commands issued per frame. This data is accessible via `SituationGetDrawCallCount()`.
*   **VRAM Monitoring:** On Vulkan, `SituationGetVRAMUsage()` now returns the precise number of bytes allocated by the engine's internal allocator (VMA), allowing for real-time memory budget monitoring.

## INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS

*   **Quad Renderer Refactor:** The internal 2D quad renderer has been modernized (Phase 2.5 prep). It now supports dynamic UV coordinates via push constants, paving the way for future GPU-accelerated text rendering.
*   **Pipeline Layout Optimization:** Vulkan internal pipelines now use more efficient layout creation strategies, reducing initialization overhead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-11-20
Version: 2.3.2D "Integrity"

## DESCRIPTION
This is a critical stability release. It addresses a severe race condition in the audio streaming subsystem, plugs memory leaks in the Vulkan swapchain recreation logic, and ensures OpenGL state isolation.

## CRITICAL FIXES

*   **Audio Stream Thread-Safety:** Completely refactored `SituationLoadSoundFromStream`. Previously, a shared global vtable caused race conditions and data corruption when loading multiple streams. This has been replaced with instance-based callback storage and static thunks, ensuring complete isolation and thread safety.
*   **Vulkan Swapchain Leak:** Fixed a memory leak where the `swapchain_images` handle array was not freed during swapchain recreation (e.g., window resize).
*   **OpenGL State Corruption:** `SituationRenderVirtualDisplays` now correctly saves and restores the Depth Test state (`GL_DEPTH_TEST`), preventing it from accidentally enabling depth testing for subsequent 2D rendering passes.

## LOGIC & SAFETY

*   **Vulkan Pipeline Barriers:** Fixed logic that prevented Execution-Only barriers (barriers with 0 access masks but valid stage masks) from being recorded.
*   **Model Loading Safety:** `SituationLoadModel` now validates texture creation. If a texture file is missing, it logs a warning instead of assigning a null ID, preventing silent rendering failures.
*   **Shader Debugging:** Increased the internal error message buffer size (to 2048 bytes) to prevent truncation of complex GLSL compilation errors.
*   **API Clarity:** `SituationCmdSetVertexAttribute` now returns a precise error message on Vulkan, explaining that vertex formats are immutable in that backend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-11-20
Version: 2.3.2C "Zero Friction"

## DESCRIPTION
This micro-release focuses purely on developer experience and removal of friction. It transforms "Situation" into a true "drop-in" library where advanced features like image loading, screenshots, and text rendering work immediately without external configuration.

## ZERO FRICTION UPDATES

*   **Embedded STB Libraries:** `stb_image`, `stb_image_write`, and `stb_truetype` are now automatically implemented by `SITUATION_IMPLEMENTATION`.
    *   **Impact:** `SituationLoadImage`, `SituationTakeScreenshot(.png)`, and `SituationDrawTextStyled` work out-of-the-box with zero additional defines or includes.
    *   **Opt-Out:** Users can define `SITUATION_NO_STB` (or specific flags like `SITUATION_NO_STB_IMAGE`) to disable this if they manage dependencies externally.

## API ADDITIONS

*   **Version Querying:** Added `SITUATION_VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH` macros and `SituationGetVersionString()` for runtime version checking.

## SUMMARY
With 2.3.2C, the "Hello World" for a graphical, audio-enabled application with font support is now literally one C file with two #defines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-11-20
Version: 2.3.2B "Consistency"

## DESCRIPTION
This hotfix eliminates cross-backend inconsistencies and improves safety. The execution-model difference between OpenGL and Vulkan is now actively enforced in debug builds.

## CRITICAL FIXES & BEHAVIORAL GUARANTEES

*   **Enforced Buffer-Update-Before-Draw Rule:** In OpenGL debug builds, `SituationUpdateBuffer` now triggers a loud warning/error if called *after* any draw command in the current frame. This prevents the most common cause of cross-backend logic divergence.
*   **SituationSetGamepadVibration Return Type:** Now returns `bool` (true on success) instead of `void`. It correctly returns `false` and sets an error on non-Windows platforms.
*   **PNG Screenshots:** `stb_image_write.h` is now automatically implemented if available (unless `SITUATION_NO_STB_PNG` is defined), fixing silent failures when saving PNGs.

## USABILITY

*   **SITUATION_BEGIN_FRAME():** Added a macro to standardize the start of the render loop (`PollInput` + `UpdateTimers`).
*   **Main-Thread Audio Capture:** Added `SITUATION_INIT_AUDIO_CAPTURE_MAIN_THREAD` flag to `SituationInitInfo`. When set, audio capture callbacks are safely routed to the main thread during `SituationPollInputEvents`, preventing threading crashes for users.
*   **Vulkan No-Shaderc Fallback:** Internal 2D renderers now elegantly disable themselves if `SITUATION_ENABLE_SHADER_COMPILER` is not defined, removing the hard dependency on `shaderc` for basic initialization.

## INTERNAL REFACTORING

*   **Vulkan Pipeline Optimization:** Refactored the internal Advanced Compositing pipeline initialization. It now reuses existing descriptor set layouts instead of allocating temporary ones, reducing code size and initialization overhead.

Version: 2.3.2A "Hotfix"

## DESCRIPTION

This is a maintenance release addressing critical issues identified in the v2.3.2 "Parity" release. It focuses on correcting data capture logic in Vulkan, improving cross-platform error reporting, and loosening dependency requirements.

## CRITICAL FIXES

*   **Fixed Vulkan Screenshot Source:** `SituationLoadImageFromScreen` (and by extension `SituationTakeScreenshot`) now captures the `current_image_index` instead of `last_presented_image_index`. Previously, taking a screenshot in Vulkan would capture the *previous* frame's output.

*   **Non-Windows Gamepad Error:** `SituationSetGamepadVibration` now properly sets the `SITUATION_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` error code on Linux and macOS, rather than failing silently.

*   **Optional Shaderc Dependency:** The `#error` forcing `SITUATION_ENABLE_SHADER_COMPILER` for Vulkan has been removed. Users can now compile the Vulkan backend without `shaderc` if they provide their own pre-compiled SPIR-V pipelines.
    *   *Note:* Disabling the compiler disables the internal 2D renderers (`SituationCmdDrawQuad` and Virtual Displays) on Vulkan, as they rely on runtime GLSL compilation.

## DOCUMENTATION

*   **Execution Model Warning:** Added a critical warning to the documentation regarding the Immediate (OpenGL) vs. Deferred (Vulkan) execution models. Developers are strictly advised to update all buffer data *before* recording draw commands to ensure consistent behavior across backends.

Version: 2.3.2 "Parity"

## DESCRIPTION

Version 2.3.2 addresses the major feature gaps identified in previous versions, achieving functional parity between the OpenGL and Vulkan backends, and introducing key new capabilities. This release enables "Advanced Blending" for Vulkan Virtual Displays, adds a complete Audio Capture (Microphone) API, and finalizes the 3D Model Exporting tools. Under the hood, it includes critical fixes for Vulkan synchronization (pipeline barriers), memory safety, and descriptor binding logic.

## NEW FEATURES

*   **Audio Capture API:** Added `SituationStartAudioCapture`, `SituationStopAudioCapture`, and the `SituationAudioCaptureCallback` type. This allows applications to record raw audio data (Mono, 32-bit Float, 44.1kHz) from the system's default input device for real-time processing.

*   **Vulkan Advanced Blending:** Implemented the complex "Copy-Before-Draw" architecture for the Vulkan backend. `SituationRenderVirtualDisplays` now correctly handles advanced blend modes (Overlay, Soft Light, etc.) on Vulkan by copying the swapchain image to a readable texture before rendering, matching the visual fidelity of the OpenGL backend.

*   **3D Model Exporting:** Finalized the `SituationSaveModelAsGltf` utility. This required implementing the previously stubbed `SituationGetMeshData` function to perform geometry readback from the GPU to CPU memory, enabling users to save runtime-generated or modified meshes to standard `.gltf` files.

## IMPROVEMENTS & FIXES

### [CRITICAL] Vulkan Synchronization & Stability
*   **Fixed Buffer Readback Synchronization:** Completely refactored `SituationGetBufferData`. It now uses a new internal helper `_SituationVulkanReadBackBuffer` that correctly inserts `vkCmdPipelineBarrier` commands before and after transfers. This fixes race conditions where the CPU would read stale data before the GPU finished writing.
*   **Fixed Texture Usage Flags:** `SituationCreateTexture` now automatically includes the `VK_IMAGE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT`. This fixes a crash/validation error when binding textures as Storage Images in compute shaders (`SituationCmdBindComputeTexture`).
*   **Fixed Memory Leaks in Buffer Updates:** Resolved memory leaks in `SituationUpdateBuffer` where temporary staging buffers were not freed if mapping or command allocation failed.

### [BUG FIXES]
*   **OpenGL Initialization:** Implemented the missing `_SituationInitGLVirtualDisplayRenderer` function. Previously, the OpenGL Virtual Display compositor relied on uninitialized Vertex Array Objects, leading to potential rendering failures.
*   **Vulkan Compute Binding:** Fixed logic in `SituationCmdBindComputeTexture` that ignored the user's `binding` parameter and always bound to index 0.
*   **API Safety:** Explicitly disabled `SituationCmdSetVertexAttribute` on the Vulkan backend (returning `SITUATION_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`), as dynamic vertex format changes are architecturally impossible in Vulkan pipelines.

### [REFACTORING]
*   **Internal Helpers:** Refactored massive logic blocks from `SituationGetBufferData` into reusable internal helpers, which allowed `SituationGetMeshData` to share the robust memory readback logic without code duplication.
*   **Documentation:** Added comprehensive header documentation for all new internal helpers (`_SituationVulkanCreateScreenCopyResource`, `_SituationVulkanReadBackBuffer`, etc.) and updated public API headers to reflect the new capabilities.

Version: 2.3.1A "Refinement"

## DESCRIPTION

Version 2.3.1A is a significant quality-of-life and performance refinement of the "Base" API. This update focuses on improving API safety, enhancing performance on the Vulkan backend, achieving greater feature parity between backends, and improving documentation clarity. While introducing no new major features, this release makes the existing API more robust, efficient, and easier to use correctly.

## CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS

### [CRITICAL] API & Main Loop Refinement

*   **Deprecated SituationUpdate():** The monolithic SituationUpdate() function has been deprecated. It encouraged a main loop structure that was less explicit and prone to off-by-one-frame input bugs.

*   **New Main Loop Workflow:** Introduced two new core functions, SituationPollInputEvents() and SituationUpdateTimers().
    -   SituationPollInputEvents() is now the dedicated function for gathering all OS events and updating input state for the current frame.
    -   SituationUpdateTimers() is the dedicated function for advancing all internal clocks, calculating delta time, and updating joystick/gamepad state.

*   **Updated Documentation:** The API documentation has been updated to reflect this new, clearer main loop structure, providing a best-practice example to guide users.

### [PERFORMANCE] Vulkan Backend Enhancements

*   **High-Performance Virtual Display Compositing:** The SituationRenderVirtualDisplays() function on the Vulkan backend has been completely overhauled. It now uses the "Persistent Descriptor Set" pattern, pre-allocating a descriptor set for each virtual display at creation time. This eliminates all runtime descriptor allocation and updates from the main render loop, resulting in a massive performance improvement when compositing many virtual displays.

*   **Unified & Performant Resource Binding:**
    -   Introduced SituationCmdBindDescriptorSet() and SituationCmdBindTextureSet() as the new, primary API for binding buffers and textures.
    -   Deprecated the older, less explicit SituationCmdBindUniformBuffer, SituationCmdBindTexture, and SituationCmdBindComputeBuffer functions, which now wrap the new API.
    -   This change leverages the persistent descriptor set model for ALL buffers and textures, making resource binding a consistently fast, low-overhead operation on Vulkan.

### [BUG FIXES & STABILITY]

*   **Fixed Input System Crash:** Resolved a critical bug where the mouse input callbacks would attempt to use an uninitialized mutex, leading to a crash. The mouse state struct now correctly contains and initializes its mutex, ensuring thread-safe event handling.

*   **Fixed Vulkan Resource Leak:** Corrected a resource leak in the internal Vulkan pipeline creation logic. The VkPipelineLayout is now properly destroyed if the subsequent vkCreateGraphicsPipelines call fails, preventing leaks on shader compilation or linking errors.

### [DOCUMENTATION & API CLARITY]

*   **Detailed Color Function Docs:** The documentation for all color conversion functions (SituationRgbToHsv, SituationColorToYPQ, etc.) and SituationImageAdjustHSV has been significantly expanded to explain the color spaces, parameter ranges, and algorithms used.

*   **Improved Image Drawing Docs:** The documentation for all SituationImageDraw...() functions has been updated to clarify their distinct rendering methods (bitmap vs. SDF), performance characteristics, boundary handling, and alpha blending formulas.

*   **Added API Safety Functions:** Introduced new helper functions to make the library's manual memory management safer and more explicit:
    -   SituationFreeDisplays() for correctly deallocating the complex SituationDisplayInfo array.
    -   SituationFreeString() as the designated function for freeing strings returned by the library.
    -   Documentation for all functions that return heap-allocated data now explicitly points to these new, safe deallocation functions.

## KNOWN ISSUES & FEATURE GAPS

*   **Vulkan Advanced Blending:** The Vulkan backend's SituationRenderVirtualDisplays function currently only supports simple blend modes (Alpha, Additive, etc.). The complex, multi-pass logic required for advanced Photoshop-style blend modes (Overlay, Soft Light), which is fully implemented in the OpenGL backend, remains a feature gap. This will be addressed in a future update.

Version: 2.3.1 "Base"

## Description

Version 2.3.1, designated as the "Base" version, establishes the foundational public API for the "Situation" library. This release provides a single-file, cross-platform C/C++ library designed to abstract low-level system interactions for windowing, graphics, audio, and input. The primary goal of this version is to offer a stable, lean, and powerful foundation for building sophisticated, high-performance software, such as games, creative coding projects, and data visualization tools.

## Scope & Key Features

This version includes a comprehensive feature set across several core domains:

*   **Lifecycle & Windowing:** Full application lifecycle management (`SituationInit`, `SituationShutdown`) and robust window controls (fullscreen, borderless, multi-monitor awareness) via a GLFW3 backend.
*   **Dual Graphics Backend:** A unified graphics API with compile-time support for both modern OpenGL (4.6+ Core) and Vulkan (1.1+). This includes abstractions for shaders, meshes, textures, and generic buffers.
*   **Command Buffer Model:** A core architectural feature for recording rendering and compute commands. This provides a modern, explicit model for GPU interaction, inspired by Vulkan.
*   **Compute Shaders:** A unified API for GPGPU tasks, supporting both OpenGL Compute Shaders and Vulkan Compute Pipelines, with runtime GLSL-to-SPIR-V compilation via `shaderc`.
*   **2D & 3D Rendering:** High-level helpers for drawing 2D primitives (quads) and textured sprites, alongside a robust system for rendering 3D meshes. Includes a Virtual Display system for off-screen rendering, UI layering, and post-processing.
*   **Audio System:** A full-featured audio engine powered by `miniaudio`, supporting playback, capture, device enumeration, and a real-time effects chain (Filters, Echo, Reverb) with support for custom DSP callbacks.
*   **Input Handling:** Unified polling and event-based handling for keyboard, mouse, and gamepads.
*   **Timing System:** Includes high-resolution timers, FPS management, and an advanced "Temporal Oscillator System" for creating rhythmically synchronized events.
*   **Filesystem Utilities:** A cross-platform API for path manipulation and file I/O, including access to standard application directories.

## Implementation Details

*   **Header-Only Library:** The library is distributed as a single header file (`situation.h`). The implementation is included by defining `SITUATION_IMPLEMENTATION` in one C/C++ file.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   **Required:** GLFW3, cglm.
    *   **Optional (Backend-Specific):** GLAD (for OpenGL), Vulkan SDK (for Vulkan).
    *   **Optional (Features):** `stb_image`, `stb_truetype`, `miniaudio`.
*   **Resource Management:** The library follows an explicit, manual resource management philosophy. All resources created with `SituationCreate*` or `SituationLoad*` functions must be manually destroyed with their corresponding `SituationDestroy*` or `SituationUnload*` functions. The library includes leak detection at shutdown to assist developers.

## Quirks & Notable Design Decisions

*   **[CRITICAL] Single-Threaded API:** All `SITAPI` functions **must** be called from the main thread (the thread that called `SituationInit`). The library is not internally synchronized, and calling API functions from other threads will lead to undefined behavior and likely crashes. Any multithreading must be managed by the client application, with communication back to the main thread for any API calls.
*   **[CRITICAL] Emulated OpenGL Command Buffer:** While the API presents a unified command buffer model, its execution differs significantly between backends. On Vulkan, commands are deferred and executed upon `SituationEndFrame()`. On OpenGL, the command buffer is an *emulation*, and `SituationCmd*` calls often translate to immediate OpenGL API calls. Developers must not write code that depends on the deferred execution of commands when using the OpenGL backend.
*   **Explicit Backend Selection:** The graphics backend (OpenGL or Vulkan) must be selected at compile time by defining either `SITUATION_USE_OPENGL` or `SITUATION_USE_VULKAN`.
*   **Manual Memory Management for Returned Data:** Functions that return dynamically allocated data (e.g., `SituationGetLastErrorMsg()`, `SituationGetDisplays()`) explicitly state that the caller is responsible for freeing the memory to prevent leaks.
