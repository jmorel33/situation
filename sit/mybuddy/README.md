**High-performance lock-free thread-caching buddy allocator for C/C++.** (v1.5.0-RC3)

MyBuddy (MBd) is a production-grade, highly concurrent memory allocator for high-performance C/C++ applications. It combines the anti-fragmentation guarantees of a classic Buddy Allocator with the lock-free speed of per-thread caching. It is designed with 32-byte SIMD-safe alignment, zero thread-exit leaks, hardened safety, and is LD_PRELOAD-ready.

## Key Features

- **Fast**: Lock-free thread-local cache delivers allocations up to 1 MiB in just a few CPU cycles, massively boosting performance for large operations. Dynamic per-order cache sizing limits ensure optimal memory utilization.
- **Lock-Free Fast Paths**: Features atomic, non-blocking pre-checks for cross-arena queue draining, virtually eliminating uncontended mutex overhead.
- **Fully Thread-Safe**: True per-thread caching with global locks grouped and acquired only on cache misses or large blocks. ThreadSanitizer (TSAN) clean, utilizing safe `_Atomic` lock-free checks across the header to eliminate concurrent coalescing race conditions. Includes a robust mutex-protected remote free queue for cross-arena allocations.
- **Hardened & Safe**: Double-free protection, underflow-protected bounds checking, check-summed magic-value validation using a global randomized XOR entropy key to mitigate heap corruption, and defused memalign exploits.
- **Memory Efficient**: Uses `MAP_NORESERVE` so virtual memory is only backed by physical RAM when used. High-order blocks (>2 MiB) are safely returned to the OS via an explicit `mbd_release_to_os()` call, which utilizes `madvise` (preferring `MADV_FREE` on Linux, falling back to `MADV_DONTNEED`) to lazily release memory while keeping the buddy pool warm to prevent hard page fault cascades on re-allocation. Includes in-place coalescing in `mbd_realloc` to avoid unnecessary copies.
- **Advanced Alignment**: Mathematically guaranteed 32-byte minimum alignment natively, plus `mbd_memalign()` for stricter requirements like AVX-512.
- **Huge Allocations**: Requests over 128 MiB seamlessly bypass the buddy pool and use tracked direct `mmap()`/`munmap()`, skipping redundant `memset` zeroing in `mbd_calloc` for directly-mapped blocks.
- **Zero Thread-Exit Leaks**: Completely reclaims dead thread caches safely using POSIX thread destructors instead of racy liveness heuristics.
- **Production Readiness**: LD_PRELOAD-safe, self-initializing, includes atomic stats tracking (`mbd_get_stats`) heavily optimized against false sharing by using 64-byte aligned per-arena structures, and custom OOM handler hooks.

## Multithreading & Concurrency

- **No False Sharing**: Thread cache data structures and heavily contended global statistics are explicitly padded and localized to 64-byte cachelines.
- **Anti-Hoarding & Thrashing Guard**: Full caches bulk-flush 50% of blocks. Mutex locks are batched during flushes to drastically reduce context switching.
- **Starvation Immunity**: If a thread's native arena runs dry, it automatically migrates and binds to an arena with available memory.

## Usage Scenarios

- **Tiny/Medium objects** (strings, ECS entities, 4 KiB pages): Stay in the lock-free cache thanks to `SMALL_ORDER_MAX` (defaults to 16).
- **Large objects** (8 KiB – 128 MiB): Handled by the global buddy path (fast O(1) doubly-linked list traversal).
- **Massive objects** (> 128 MiB): Seamlessly routed to direct OS mmaps.

## Quick Start

MyBuddy is a single-header library. To use it, you just need to include the header. However, exactly **one** C or C++ file in your project must define `MYBUDDY_IMPLEMENTATION` before including the header to instantiate the implementation.

### Implementation File (`mybuddy.c` or similar):
```c
#define MYBUDDY_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "mybuddy.h"
```

### Other Files:
```c
#include "mybuddy.h"

int main() {
    // Lock-free fast path (falls under SMALL_ORDER_MAX)
    char *string_buffer = mbd_alloc(128);

    // AVX-512 strict alignment
    float *simd_data = mbd_memalign(64, 1024 * sizeof(float));

    // Huge allocation (bypasses buddy pool, uses direct mmap)
    void *massive_asset = mbd_alloc(1024 * 1024 * 256);

    mbd_free(string_buffer);
    mbd_free(simd_data);
    mbd_free(massive_asset);

    // Fetch accurate diagnostics
    mbd_stats_t stats = mbd_get_stats();

    mbd_destroy(); // Safe here, no other threads running
    return 0;
}
```

### Cross-thread Stress testing
If you want to run extensive tests with multithreaded extreme load cases, the test suite includes `test_multithread_stress.c` covering TSAN / ASAN validation on 16 threads cross-freeing millions of blocks dynamically.

Use `make test` inside the project to automatically run the suite!

*Note: The allocator is self-initializing. The first call to `mbd_alloc()` or `mbd_free()` will automatically initialize the pool. For latency-sensitive applications, you may still call `mbd_init()` explicitly during startup.*

### Thread Safety Contract
`mbd_destroy()` must only be called after all threads using the allocator have exited. Violating this contract causes undefined behavior. The allocator will abort in debug and release builds if active threads are detected.

## Configuration Settings

The allocator can be configured globally by passing an `mbd_config_t` struct to `mbd_init`. If passed as `NULL`, or if the allocator auto-initializes, safe performance-oriented defaults are used.

```c
typedef struct {
    uint32_t flags;
    int arena_count;
    size_t pool_size;

    /* Order Limits */
    uint32_t min_order;           // Default: 6 (64 bytes)
    uint32_t max_order;           // Default: 27 (128 MiB)
    uint32_t small_order_max;     // Default: 20 (1 MiB)
    uint32_t large_cutoff_order;  // Default: 14 (16 KiB)

    /* Cache Sizing & Thresholds */
    uint32_t cache_limits[32];    // Max order is 31, so 32 slots is safe
    uint32_t mmap_cache_slots;    // Default: 8
    uint32_t mmap_max_waste_ratio;// Default: 4
    size_t   cache_pressure_threshold; // Default: 4 MiB

    /* Advanced Heuristics */
    uint8_t  flush_high_watermark_pct;  // Default: 100 (Flush when 100% full)
    uint8_t  flush_low_watermark_pct;   // Default: 50  (Flush down to 50%)
    uint32_t refill_batch_size;         // Default: 0 (Unlimited/Fill to max)
    uint32_t max_remote_frees_per_lock; // Default: 0 (Unlimited)
    uint32_t migration_return_freq;     // Default: 64
    size_t   hugepage_threshold;        // Default: 2097152 (2 MiB)
} mbd_config_t;
```

- **`flags`**: Bitmask for allocator flags. Available options:
  - `MBD_FLAG_HARDENED`: Enables bounds checking, XOR check-summed header validation, and double-free protection. (Disabled by default due to performance overhead).
  - `MBD_FLAG_ATOMIC_STATS`: Enables atomic tracking of stats like cache hits and misses. (Enabled by default).
  - `MBD_FLAG_REALLOC_LOCK`: Enables briefly taking the arena lock during `realloc` for possible coalescing (Enabled by default).
  - `MBD_FLAG_MADV_RELEASE`: Enables using `MADV_FREE` / `MADV_DONTNEED` to eagerly release pages to the OS. (Enabled by default).
  - `MBD_FLAG_BUDDY_LARGE`: Forces the buddy allocator to handle all allocation sizes up to max order. Disables exact-fit direct mmap. (Disabled by default).
- **`arena_count`**: The number of independent arenas to partition memory across. Defaults to the number of CPU cores minus one.
- **`pool_size`**: The total reservation capacity in bytes per arena.
- **`cache_limits`**: An array dictating the maximum number of blocks a thread cache can hold for each buddy order size. Tuned to prevent thrashing. (If array is empty, defaults are applied).
- **`mmap_max_waste_ratio`**: Controls how much larger a cached mmap block can be compared to the requested size (e.g. 4 means up to 4x). A value of 1 enforces exact-fit. A value of 0 defaults to 4.
- **`cache_pressure_threshold`**: Controls aggressive vs. lazy flushing. When a thread's total cached bytes exceed this threshold, it triggers a bulk flush. Lower values force frequent returns to the global pool (good for memory-constrained or high thread-churn environments), while higher values allow lazy hoarding for max performance. Defaults to 4 MiB.
- **`min_order`**: The minimum allocation order size handled by the buddy allocator. Defaults to 6 (64 bytes).
- **`max_order`**: The maximum allocation order size handled by the buddy allocator. Defaults to 27 (128 MiB).
- **`small_order_max`**: The maximum order size handled by the lock-free thread-local cache. Defaults to 20 (1 MiB).
- **`large_cutoff_order`**: The order size above which allocations bypass the buddy pool and use exact-fit mmap. Defaults to 14 (16 KiB).
- **`mmap_cache_slots`**: The maximum number of slots available in the thread-local mmap cache. Defaults to 8.
- **`flush_high_watermark_pct`**: The percentage of the cache limit at which a cache flush is triggered. Defaults to 100 (100%).
- **`flush_low_watermark_pct`**: The percentage of the cache limit to flush down to. Defaults to 50 (50%). These two watermark parameters dictate the dynamic bulk-flushing behavior of thread caches by setting the percentage limits relative to the configured cache limits.
- **`refill_batch_size`**: Limits the number of blocks refilled into a thread cache from an arena free list during a single lock acquisition. A value of 0 fills to the max capacity. Defaults to 0.
- **`max_remote_frees_per_lock`**: Limits the number of blocks drained from a remote free queue into an arena free list per operation to bound lock times. A value of 0 is unlimited. Defaults to 0.
- **`migration_return_freq`**: How frequently an allocation checks to return to a thread's home arena after it was forced to migrate to another. Defaults to 64.
- **`hugepage_threshold`**: Allocation sizes above this threshold will attempt to use huge pages. Defaults to 2 MiB.

### Parameter Interactions
| Parameter | Interacts With | Effect |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| `cache_pressure_threshold` | `flush_high_watermark_pct` | Both can trigger flushes — which fires first? |
| `refill_batch_size` | `cache_limits[]` | Batch > limit = wasted work |
| `migration_return_freq` | `arena_count` | More arenas = more migration opportunities |

## API Reference

### Core Memory Operations
- `void mbd_init(const mbd_config_t *config);`
  Explicitly initializes the allocator with an optional configuration struct (pass `NULL` for defaults). The config allows you to override total pool size, number of arenas, hardening flags (`MBD_FLAG_HARDENED`), and per-order thread cache limits.
- `void mbd_destroy(void);`
  Destroys the allocator and unmaps all arenas. Strictly for unit-testing and clean process teardown.
- `void *mbd_alloc(size_t requested_size);`
  Allocates a block of memory of the specified size. Returns a 32-byte aligned pointer.
- `void mbd_free(void *ptr);`
  Frees a previously allocated block of memory. Includes bounds checking and double-free protection.
- `void *mbd_realloc(void *ptr, size_t new_size);`
  Reallocates a memory block to a new size.
- `void *mbd_calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size);`
  Allocates zero-initialized memory for an array.
- `void *mbd_memalign(size_t alignment, size_t size);`
  Allocates memory with a specific alignment (e.g., for AVX-512).
- `size_t mbd_malloc_usable_size(const void *ptr);`
  Returns the number of usable bytes in an allocated block.
- `mbd_stats_t mbd_get_stats(void);`
  Returns accurate diagnostics of mapped, allocated, and free bytes.
- `void mbd_set_oom_handler(void (*handler)(void));`
  Sets a custom Out-Of-Memory handler hook.
- `void mbd_set_profiler_hook(void (*hook)(mbd_event_type_t, void*, size_t));`
  Sets a custom profiler hook.
- `void mbd_release_to_os(void);`
  Explicitly returns unused high-order memory (blocks >= 2 MiB) to the operating system using `madvise`.
- `void mbd_trim(void);`
  Forces a trim of all thread caches, returning memory to the global arena, and subsequently calls `mbd_release_to_os()`.
- `void mbd_dump(void);`
  Prints the current state of the global free lists for diagnostics.
