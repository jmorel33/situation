---

## [v2.4.27] - Advanced Grid Ops
- **Grid Streaming**: Added `EXT;grid;stream` for high-performance bulk cell updates.
    - Uses packed binary data (CH+ATTR) encoded in Base64 for escape safety.
    - Supports sparse updates via attribute masks (e.g., update only FG color for a region).
    - Prevents race conditions by flushing the operation queue before read-modify-write cycles.
- **Copy & Move**: Added `EXT;grid;copy` and `EXT;grid;move` subcommands.
    - Performs rectangular blit operations entirely on the GPU/Grid side.
    - `move` automatically clears the source region after copying.
    - Supports overwrite modes (`PROTECTED` bypass).
- **Masked Fill Fix**: Updated `EXT;grid;fill` to correctly utilize `KTERM_OP_FILL_RECT_MASKED`, enabling true masked fills that preserve existing cell attributes (e.g., change background color while keeping text).
- **Safety**: Hardened `stream` against division-by-zero errors by clamping dimensions. Fixed inconsistent viewport bounds checking in internal copy operations.
- **API**: Introduced `KTerm_QueueCopyRectWithMode` to support advanced copy flags while maintaining ABI compatibility for `KTerm_QueueCopyRect`.

## [v2.4.26] - Forms & Relative Grid
- **Forms Mode Enhancements**:
    - **Skip Protect Navigation**: Cursor movement (Right, Left, Tab, Backspace) now automatically skips protected cells (`DECSCA 1`) if `SKIP_PROTECT` is enabled via Gateway (`SET;CURSOR;SKIP_PROTECT=1`).
    - **Configurable Home**: Added `HOME_MODE` to `SET;CURSOR`. Options include `ABSOLUTE` (0,0), `FIRST_UNPROTECTED` (scan grid), `FIRST_UNPROTECTED_LINE` (scan current line), and `LAST_FOCUSED` (return to last known unprotected cell).
    - **Focus Tracking**: The terminal now tracks the last valid cursor position on an unprotected cell for use with `HOME_MODE=LAST_FOCUSED`.
- **Relative Grid Coords**: Gateway Grid operations (`fill`, `fill_circle`, `fill_line`, `banner`) now support relative coordinates prefixed with `+` or `-` (e.g., `x=+5`, `y=-2`).
- **Negative Dimensions**: Negative width/height/length parameters in Grid ops now reverse the drawing direction (mirroring), allowing for intuitive "draw left" or "draw up" commands.
- **Strict Mode**: If `strict_mode` is enabled, negative absolute grid coordinates are clamped to 0, while explicit relative coordinates are preserved.

## [v2.4.25] - Forms & Parser Enhancements
- **Cursor Skip Protect**: Implemented "forms mode" cursor navigation. When enabled (`SET;CURSOR;SKIP_PROTECT=1`), cursor movement commands (`CUF`, `CUB`, `CUD`, `CUU`, etc.) automatically skip over protected cells (`DECSCA 1`), wrapping to the next line if necessary.
- **Signed Numeric Params**: Hardened CSI/OSC/DCS parser to support signed integer parameters (e.g., `CSI -5 ; ...`). Negative values are preserved unless `strict_mode` is enabled, in which case they are clamped to 0.
- **Safe Grid Ops**: Enhanced Gateway Grid operations (`fill`, `fill_circle`, `banner`, `fill_line`) to be out-of-bound safe. They now silently ignore off-screen plots instead of clipping harshly or erroring, and return the count of actually applied (in-bound) cells.
- **Gateway**: Added `SET;CURSOR;SKIP_PROTECT=1` to toggle the new cursor behavior.

## [v2.4.24] - Gateway Grid Flexible Params
- **Flexible Syntax**: Gateway Grid extension (`EXT;grid`) now supports optional/empty parameters (`switch;;;;value`). Omitted parameters default to the current session attributes (if masked in) or are ignored (if masked out).
- **Stencil Mode**: Excluding the `CH` (Character) bit from the mask in `fill` or `banner` commands now acts as a stencil, applying colors and attributes to the shape without modifying the underlying text characters.
- **Design Mode**: Gateway Grid operations now bypass the `PROTECTED` attribute check, enabling host applications to overwrite protected cells (e.g., carving out editable fields in a protected form background).
- **Named Attributes**: Added support for human-readable attribute flags (e.g., `PROTECTED|BOLD`) in Gateway commands via `KTerm_ParseAttributeString`.
- **Robustness**: Replaced `strtok` with a custom tokenizer in `KTerm_Ext_Grid` to correctly handle empty fields in semicolon-separated lists.
- **Fixes**: Resolved a critical regression where DCS payloads containing `p` or `q` (e.g., `pal:1`) incorrectly triggered protocol switches by enforcing strict DCS header validation.

## [v2.4.23] - Gateway Grid Banner
- **Gateway Extensions**: Added `banner` subcommand to the `grid` extension (`EXT;grid;banner;...`).
    - Plots large text directly onto the grid using a built-in bitmap font (IBM 8x8).
    - Supports scaling, alignment (left/center/right), and masked styling (color, attributes).
    - Bypasses escape sequence parsing for high-performance dashboard/overlay construction.

## [v2.4.22] - Gateway Grid Shapes
- **Gateway Extensions**: Expanded `grid` extension with `fill_circle` and `fill_line` subcommands.
    - `fill_circle`: Draws filled circles using the midpoint algorithm.
    - `fill_line`: Draws linear spans in cardinal directions (h, v) with optional wrapping for horizontal lines.
- **Fixes**: Fixed `fill` subcommand to correctly handle 0-width/height arguments (defaulting to 1).
- **Architecture**: Refactored `KTerm_Ext_Grid` to use a shared `GridStyle` helper.

## [v2.4.21] - Gateway Grid Extension
- **Gateway Extensions**: Added `grid` extension for bulk screen manipulation.
- **Commands**: Implemented `EXT;grid;fill` subcommand to efficienty fill rectangular regions with specific characters and attributes.
- **Operations**: Added `KTERM_OP_FILL_RECT_MASKED` to the operation queue to support masked attribute updates (Char, FG, BG, Underline, Strike, Flags).
- **Testing**: Added `tests/test_gateway_grid.c` to verify grid manipulation capabilities.

## [v2.4.20]

### Gateway RAWDUMP & Direct Input
- **RAWDUMP:** Added `rawdump` Gateway extension (`EXT;rawdump;START;SESSION=n`) to mirror raw input bytes to a target session as literal characters. This bypasses the VT parser, enabling powerful debugging and visualization of escape sequences.
- **Direct Input:** Added `direct` Gateway extension (`EXT;direct;1`) to toggle `KTERM_MODE_DIRECT_INPUT` at runtime via the Gateway Protocol, allowing per-session control of local editing modes.
- **Protocol:** Fully integrated with the Gateway Protocol, supporting session targeting (`SESSION=ID`) and explicit acknowledgments ("OK", "ACTIVE", "STOPPED").

## [v2.4.19]

### Unified Event Pipeline & Direct Input
- **Unified Processing:** Introduced `KTerm_ProcessEvent` as the single, centralized entry point for all input types (Bytes, Keys, Mouse, Resize, Focus, Paste), simplifying the integration surface.
- **KTermEvent Union:** Replaced fragmented input structs with a unified `KTermEvent` tagged union, renaming the legacy `KTermEvent` to `KTermKeyEvent` for clarity.
- **Direct Input Mode:** Implemented `KTERM_MODE_DIRECT_INPUT` (Direct Mode). When enabled, printable keys are inserted directly into the grid (Local Editing) without generating VT escape sequences, perfect for local line editing or chat input fields.
- **Centralized Translation:** Moved VT key sequence generation logic from the IO adapter (`kt_io_sit.h`) into the core `KTerm_TranslateKey` function, ensuring consistent behavior across all input sources.
- **API Unification:** `KTerm_WriteChar`, `KTerm_WriteString`, and `KTerm_WriteFormat` now wrap `KTerm_ProcessEvent`, ensuring consistent behavior and overflow handling across all input methods.
- **Mouse Fallback:** `KTerm_ProcessEvent` now gracefully handles mouse wheel events by falling back to standard scrolling (or Alt-Screen arrows) if Mouse Tracking is disabled, preventing "dead scroll" issues.

## [v2.4.18]

### Gateway Extensions
- **Modular Extension System:** Introduced `KTerm_RegisterGatewayExtension` to allow host applications to register custom Gateway commands under the `EXT` namespace (`DCS GATE ... EXT;name;args ST`).
- **Built-in Kittens:** Added built-in extensions for common tasks:
    - **broadcast:** Sends input to all open sessions (`broadcast;text`).
    - **themes:** Sets background color via OSC 11 (`themes;set;bg=#RRGGBB`).
    - **icat:** Basic image injection using the Kitty Graphics Protocol (`icat;base64_data`).
    - **clipboard:** Placeholder for clipboard operations (`clipboard;set;text`, `clipboard;get`).
- **API:** Added `GatewayResponseCallback` and `GatewayExtHandler` typedefs for extension implementation.

## [v2.4.17]

### Input Pipeline Decoupling
- **Architecture:** Replaced the legacy fixed-size `input_pipeline` with a dynamic, lock-free Single-Producer Single-Consumer (SPSC) queue (`KTermInputQueue`) per session. This decouples the input source (host/PTY) from the processing loop, preventing stalls during high-throughput operations.
- **Batch Processing:** Implemented `KTerm_PushInput` for efficient batch injection of input data. The consumer loop now processes events in batches (`burst_threshold`), significantly improving throughput for large pastes or AI streams.
- **Backpressure:** The new queue architecture supports basic backpressure monitoring and overflow detection, laying the groundwork for advanced flow control (XOFF/XON).
- **Diagnostics:** Updated `KTerm_ShowDiagnostics` and `KTerm_GetStatus` to report accurate queue usage metrics.

## [v2.4.16]

### Shader Config Refactor & Hot-Reload
- **Refactoring:** Moved shader visual parameters (CRT curvature, scanline intensity, glow, noise, flags) from Push Constants to a dedicated `ConfigBuffer` (SSBO). This allows for runtime configuration without pipeline reconstruction.
- **Hot-Reload:** Implemented `SET;SHADER` and `GET;SHADER` Gateway commands to dynamically configure visual effects.
- **New Effects:** Added support for Glow (bloom approximation) and Noise effects in the compute shader.
- **Safety:** Replaced `union` with `struct` in `KTermToken` (kt_parser.h) to prevent data corruption during float parsing (type punning fix).
- **Compliance:** Reverted `strtod` to `strtof` in parser logic to maintain strict C11 compliance and portability.

## [v2.4.15]

### Compositor Modularization
- **Modularization:** Extracted the layout compositing logic into a new module `kt_composite_sit.h`, implementing `KTermCompositor`.
- **Decoupling:** Decoupled `KTerm` core from direct render buffer management. The `KTerm` struct now holds a `KTermCompositor` instance.
- **Refactoring:** Moved GPU structure definitions (`GPUCell`, `GPUVectorLine`, etc.) and `KTermRenderBuffer` to the new module.
- **Implementation:** `KTerm_PrepareRenderBuffer`, `KTerm_Draw` logic, and `KTerm_Resize` logic now delegate to `KTermCompositor_*` functions.
- **Fixes:** Addressed dependency issues with `GetScreenRow` and `KTerm_BuildRun` by careful ordering of includes and moving helper functions.

## [v2.4.14]

### Refactoring & Magic Numbers
- **Session Cleanup Refactor:** Extracted `KTerm_CleanupSession` helper function to consolidate and fix memory cleanup logic for session resources (screen buffers, graphics state, macros, etc.), addressing potential leaks in multi-session scenarios.
- **Initialization Refactor:** Extracted `KTerm_ResetSessionDefaults` to separate default state initialization from memory allocation in `KTerm_InitSession`.
- **Magic Numbers:** Replaced hardcoded blink rate oscillator slots with named constants `KTERM_OSC_SLOT_FAST_BLINK` (30) and `KTERM_OSC_SLOT_SLOW_BLINK` (35) for better maintainability.

## [v2.4.13]

### DECRQSS Extensions & Fixes
- **Extended DECRQSS Support:** Implemented `DECRQSS` (`DCS $ q`) handlers for:
    - `"p` (DECSCL): Reports Conformance Level (e.g., `1;1"p`).
    - ` q` (DECSCUSR): Reports Cursor Style (e.g., `1 q`).
    - `*x` (DECSACE): Reports Attribute Change Extent (`2*x`).
    - `*|` (DECSNLS): Reports Number of Lines per Screen.
- **Parser Fix:** Resolved an issue where the 7-bit String Terminator (`ESC \`) triggered an "Unknown ESC" error when processed outside of a string context. It is now correctly handled as a NOP.

## [v2.4.12]

### Deep XTerm Dynamic Colors Compliance
- **Multi-Parameter Parsing:** Updated `ProcessKTermColorCommand` to correctly handle multiple color specifications in a single `OSC 4` sequence (e.g., `OSC 4;1;red;2;green ST`), addressing a compliance gap where only the first pair was processed.
- **Enhanced Verification:** Added `tests/verify_osc_parsing.c` with a comprehensive suite for dynamic colors (OSC 4/10/11/12), covering sets, queries, specific resets (OSC 104), and high-load stress testing.
- **Parser Robustness:** Updated `ProcessKTermColorCommand` to use explicit `Stream_Consume` for token advancement, improving parsing reliability for complex OSC strings.

## [v2.4.11]

### Extended DECRQSS & Test Suite Modernization
- **Extended Query Support:** Added support for `DECRQSS` (`DCS $ q`) queries:

    - `t` (DECSLPP): Reports Lines per Page (`Ht`).
    - `|` (DECSCPP): Reports Columns per Page (`W|`).
- **Test Modernization:** Refactored the test suite to use the modern `KTerm_Update` and callback API, eliminating deprecated direct buffer access.
- **Consolidation:** Merged legacy unit tests (`test_ansi_sys`, `test_csi_coverage`, etc.) into a unified, clean verification suite (`tests/verify_*.c`).
- **Fixes:** Resolved build issues in `tests/test_dec_features.c` by ensuring correct definitions for response buffers and key codes.

## [v2.4.10]

### Shader-based Bold & Italic Simulation
- **Visuals:** Implemented shader-based simulation for **Bold** (smear effect) and **Italic** (coordinate skew) text attributes in `shaders/terminal.comp`.
- **Accuracy:** Added bounds checking to texture sampling to prevent atlas bleeding when distorting glyph coordinates.
- **Completeness:** These attributes are now visually distinct even when using the standard bitmap font, improving readability and styling support.

## [v2.4.9]

### Session Routing, Queries, Macros, State Snapshot
- **Per-Session Response Routing:** Fixed critical data contention issues in multi-session environments. Responses (`DSR`, `OSC`) are now routed exclusively to the originating session's ring buffer (`response_ring`) instead of the active session, ensuring 100% reliable output handling for background tasks.
- **Expanded Query Handlers:** Added support for `CSI ?10n` (Graphics Capabilities), `?20n` (Macro Storage), and `?30n` (Session State). Fixed `CSI 98n` (Error Reporting) to comply with standard syntax.
- **Macro Acknowledgements:** Implemented robust success/error reporting for DCS macro definitions (`\x1BP1$sOK\x1B\` / `\x1BP1$sERR\x1B\`), enabling reliable upload flows for host applications.
- **State Snapshot:** Added `DECRQSS` (`DCS $ q`) support for state snapshots (`state` argument), returning a packed, parsable string of the terminal's cursor, modes, and attributes for session persistence or debugging.

## [v2.4.8]

### Parser Hardening & Fuzzing Support

- **Continuous Fuzzing:** Added `tests/libfuzzer_target.c` and GitHub Actions workflow for continuous regression fuzzing with libFuzzer/AddressSanitizer, targeting parser robustness against malformed sequences.
- **Strict Mode:** Exposed `strict_mode` in `KTermConfig` to enforce stricter parsing rules.

## [v2.4.7]

### Memory & Sanitizer Hardening
- **ReGIS Memory Safety:** Fixed memory leaks in ReGIS macro handling by properly freeing existing macros before re-initialization or reset commands (`RESET;REGIS`).
- **Shutdown Cleanup:** Enhanced `KTerm_Cleanup` to ensure all internal buffers (e.g., `row_dirty`, `row_scratch_buffer`) are freed, eliminating leaks on session destruction.
- **Buffer Hardening:** Mitigated buffer overflow risks in `KTerm_SetLevel` by enforcing correct size limits on the answerback buffer.
- **Sanitizer Compliance:** The codebase is now verified clean under AddressSanitizer (ASan) and Valgrind, ensuring robust operation in CI environments.

## [v2.4.6]

### Conversational UI Hardening
- **Synchronized Output (DECSET 2026):** Implemented support for synchronized updates to prevent visual tearing during rapid text streaming (e.g., from LLMs).
- **Focus Tracking:** Added support for `CSI ? 1004 h` (Focus In/Out events) and introduced `KTerm_SetFocus` API to report focus state to the terminal.
- **Clipboard Hardening:** Increased `MAX_COMMAND_BUFFER` to 256KB to support large clipboard operations via OSC 52, ensuring robust handling of large pastes.
- **Tests:** Added `tests/stress_interleaved_io.c` for I/O stress testing and `tests/mock_situation.h` for robust unit testing without external dependencies. Expanded `tests/verify_clipboard.c` to test large payloads.
- **Fixes:** Resolved compilation issues in tests by introducing a mock layer for the Situation framework.

## [v2.4.5]

### Hardened Conversational Interface & Kitty Protocol
- **Kitty Keyboard Protocol:** Full implementation of the progressive keyboard enhancement protocol (`CSI > 1 u`), enabling unambiguous key reporting (distinguishing `Tab` vs `Ctrl+I`, `Enter` vs `Ctrl+Enter`), explicit modifier reporting (Shift, Alt, Ctrl, Super), and key release events.
- **Input Hardening:** Introduced `KTermKey` enum for standardized key codes and hardened the `ParseCSI` logic to correctly handle modern prefix parameters (e.g., `>`).
- **Ring Buffer Integration:** Finalized the per-session `response_ring` integration for robust, lock-free output interleaving in high-throughput conversational scenarios (AI streaming, chat UIs).

## [v2.4.4]

### Conversational Completeness & Output Refactor
- **Per-Session Output Ring:** Replaced the legacy linear output buffer with a lock-free, per-session ring buffer (`response_ring`). This ensures thread-safe, non-blocking response generation in multi-session environments and prevents data drops under load.
- **Expanded Query Support:** Added new DSR queries for inspecting internal state:
    -   `CSI ? 10 n`: Graphics capabilities bitmask (Sixel, ReGIS, Kitty, etc.).
    -   `CSI ? 20 n`: Macro storage usage (slots used, free bytes).
    -   `CSI ? 30 n`: Session state (active ID, max sessions, scroll region).
    -   `CSI 98 n`: Internal error count.
- **Macro Acknowledgments:** Macro definitions now reply with `DCS > ID ; Status ST` (0=Success, 1=Full, 2=Error), allowing hosts to verify uploads.
- **Gateway State Snapshot:** New `GET;STATE` command returns a packed, comprehensive snapshot of the terminal's state (cursor, modes, attributes, scroll region) for seamless reattachment or debugging.

## [v2.4.3]

### Multi-Session Graphics & Lifecycle Fixes
- **Tektronix Isolation:** Moved Tektronix graphics state from global storage to per-session storage (`KTermSession`), ensuring that vector graphics in one session do not bleed into others. Updated `ProcessTektronixChar` and initialization logic to use the session-specific context.
- **Kitty Lifecycle:** Fixed Kitty graphics lifecycle issues during resize events. Implemented `KTerm_ApplyResizeOp` remapping logic to correctly update the logical `start_row` of images when the terminal grid is resized, preventing visual artifacts or lost images in the scrollback buffer.
- **Initialization:** Standardized graphics subsystem initialization (Sixel, ReGIS, Tektronix, Kitty) within `KTerm_InitSession`, removing redundant global initialization code and ensuring all sessions start with a clean, isolated state.
- **API Update:** Updated `KTerm_InitKitty` signature to match Sixel/ReGIS patterns for consistency.

## [v2.4.2]

### Stabilization & Lifecycle Fixes
- **Graphics Lifecycle:** Fixed a confirmed memory leak where Sixel graphics data for background sessions was not correctly freed during `KTerm_Cleanup`.
- **ReGIS Isolation:** Enforced strict per-session isolation for ReGIS state (colors, positions, macros) by updating `KTerm_InitReGIS` to accept an explicit session context. This resolves potential state crosstalk in multi-session environments.
- **Documentation:** Updated API documentation to transparently acknowledge that while ReGIS *state* is isolated, the vector output layer is currently a global shared resource. Sixel rendering is also clarified as being limited to the active session overlay for now.
- **Testing:** Added comprehensive stress tests (`stress_op_queue`, `stress_resize`) and isolation verification (`verify_regis_isolation`) to the test suite.

## [v2.4.1]

### ReGIS Per-Session State
- **Refactoring:** Moved ReGIS graphics state (cursor position, macros, colors) from the global `KTerm` struct to the per-session `KTermSession` struct. This ensures that in multi-session environments (e.g., split panes or background sessions), each terminal session maintains its own independent graphics context.
- **Cleanup:** Fixed a duplicate `struct` definition issue where a block of code defining `regis` was erroneously duplicated in the header. Extracted the ReGIS state definition into a named `KTermReGIS` typedef for clarity.
- **API Update:** Updated `KTerm_InitReGIS` and internal helpers to operate on specific session instances.

## [v2.4.0]

### Finalize Op Queue Decoupling – Mandatory Mode Achieved

- Made op queue **mandatory** (removed `use_op_queue` flag and all fallback paths).
- All grid mutations (cell set, scroll, rect ops, vertical insert/delete, resize) now unconditionally queue operations.
- Added `KTERM_OP_RESIZE_GRID` + full queuing for dynamic resizes (Gateway/host-triggered).
- Cleaned up struct ordering, forward declarations, font includes, and test compilation issues.
- Tests: `test_full_decoupling.c` verifies deferred mutations; rect/vertical suites pass cleanly.
- Docs: Updated to reflect mandatory queue, full coverage, and post-flush grid purity.

This completes the multi-version refactor arc (started v2.3.40) — grid is now fully declarative/batched, thread-safe, and directly addressable after flush. Ready for per-cell extensions, bytecode, and next-gen renderer integration.

## [v2.3.44] (pre-release)
- Cleaned up struct ordering, forward declarations, font includes, and test compilation issues.
- Tests: `test_full_decoupling.c` verifies deferred mutations; rect/vertical suites pass cleanly.
- Docs: Updated to reflect mandatory queue, full coverage, and post-flush grid purity.

This completes the multi-version refactor arc (started v2.3.40) — grid is now fully declarative/batched, thread-safe, and directly addressable after flush. Ready for per-cell extensions, bytecode, and next-gen renderer integration.

## [v2.3.43]

### Mandatory Op Queue & Decoupling
- **Architecture:** Completed core refactoring to make the `KTermOpQueue` mandatory and fully decoupled from direct grid mutation.
- **Queue Expansion:** Added `KTERM_OP_RESIZE_GRID` to `kt_ops.h` and increased queue capacity to 16384 to handle bursty resize events.
- **Unified Mutation:** Updated all grid mutation functions (`InsertLines`, `DeleteLines`, `Scroll`, `Insert/DeleteChar`, `RectOps`) to unconditionally queue operations, removing the `use_op_queue` flag.
- **Resize Logic:** Refactored `KTerm_ResizeSession` to queue resize operations (`KTERM_OP_RESIZE_GRID`) instead of applying them immediately, ensuring thread safety and rendering consistency (direct application remains available via `KTERM_DEBUG_DIRECT`).
- **Testing:** Added `tests/test_full_decoupling.c` to verify that complex mutations like resizes and line insertions are correctly deferred until the flush phase.

## [v2.3.42]

### Expanded Input Op Queue
- **Vertical Ops:** Added support for `INSERT_LINES` (IL) and `DELETE_LINES` (DL) in the `KTermOpQueue`.
- **Scrolling:** Refactored `KTerm_ScrollUpRegion_Internal` and `KTerm_ScrollDownRegion_Internal` to queue `SCROLL_REGION` ops when `use_op_queue` is active.
- **Refactoring:** Updated internal handlers for `ExecuteIL` and `ExecuteDL` to utilize the queue.
- **Optimization:** Vertical line operations are now applied atomically during the flush phase, with correct protected cell handling (aborting if protected cells are in the region).

## [v2.3.41]

### Expanded Input Op Queue
- **Rectangular Ops:** Added support for `FILL_RECT`, `COPY_RECT` (DECCRA), and `SET_ATTR_RECT` (DECCARA/DECRARA) in the `KTermOpQueue`.
- **Refactoring:** Updated internal handlers for `ExecuteDECFRA`, `KTerm_CopyRectangle`, and `ExecuteDECCARA` to utilize the queue when `session->use_op_queue` is active.
- **Optimization:** Rectangular operations are now applied atomically during the flush phase, reducing potential visual tearing and improving batching efficiency.

## [v2.3.40]

### New Features & Optimizations
- **Input Op Queue:** Implemented a lock-free input operation queue (`KTermOpQueue`) to decouple input parsing from direct grid mutation. This allows for atomic batch updates and improves thread safety during high-throughput scenarios.
- **JIT Text Shaping:** Introduced Just-In-Time text shaping (`KTermTextRun`). The renderer now dynamically groups characters (e.g., base characters + combining marks) into logical runs at render time. This resolves longstanding issues with combining character display and ensures correct visual representation without complicating the underlying grid storage.
- **Combining Character Storage:** Combining characters are now stored in their own grid cells with the `KTERM_FLAG_COMBINING` flag, preserving the input stream's integrity while allowing the JIT renderer to collapse them visually.
- **Dirty Rect Optimization:** The flush logic now calculates a minimal `dirty_rect` for pending operations. `KTerm_PrepareRenderBuffer` utilizes this to perform partial GPU buffer uploads, significantly reducing bandwidth usage and improving performance on large terminals or during partial updates.

### Safety & Stability
- **Leak Fix:** Fixed a memory leak in `KTerm_Cleanup` where the `KTermLayout` structure was not being freed, particularly in scenarios where initialization failed after layout creation.
- **Destruction Hardening:** Refactored `KTerm_Destroy` to delegate all resource cleanup to `KTerm_Cleanup`, ensuring a single source of truth for teardown logic.
- **Safety:** Added pointer nullification after freeing resources in `KTerm_Cleanup` to prevent double-free vulnerabilities if the cleanup function is invoked multiple times.

## [v2.3.38]

### Output Architecture
- **Sink Output Pattern:** Introduced `KTerm_SetOutputSink` to allow applications to register a direct output callback (`KTermOutputSink`). This enables zero-copy data transmission from the terminal to the host, bypassing the legacy ring buffer. This is ideal for high-throughput scenarios.
- **Unified Output Logic:** Refactored the internal output system (`KTerm_WriteInternal`) to consolidate logic for both legacy buffered output and the new direct sink output. This eliminates code duplication between `KTerm_QueueResponse` and `KTerm_QueueResponseBytes`.
- **Binary Safety:** The new write primitive correctly distinguishes between string and binary data, ensuring null terminators are only appended when appropriate and preventing buffer corruption for binary protocols.
- **Automatic Flushing:** Setting a new output sink automatically flushes any data remaining in the legacy buffer to the new sink, ensuring no data loss during transition.

## [v2.3.37]

### Architecture & Layout
- **Layout Engine Decoupling:** Extracted the multiplexer layout engine logic into a new `kt_layout.h` module.
- **Modular Design:** `KTerm_Resize`, `KTerm_SplitPane`, and `KTerm_ClosePane` now delegate to the `KTermLayout` API, decoupling geometry calculations from the terminal emulation core.
- **Refactoring:** Replaced embedded `KTermPane` structures in `KTerm` with a `KTermLayout*` handle, paving the way for alternative layout strategies (tabs, floating windows).

## [v2.3.36]

### Error Reporting & Stability
- **Structured API:** Introduced a new error reporting system with `KTermErrorLevel`, `KTermErrorSource`, and user callbacks (`KTerm_SetErrorCallback`). This replaces ad-hoc `stderr` logging with a unified mechanism.
- **Integration:** Integrated error reporting into critical paths: `KTerm_InitSession` (memory), `KTerm_Resize` (buffer alloc), `KTerm_LoadFont` (file IO), `KTerm_InitCompute` (pipeline), and Gateway (unknown commands).
- **Hardening:** Fixed a potential heap corruption issue in `KTerm_Resize` where a failed buffer reallocation would update the size counter without updating the buffer capacity, leading to out-of-bounds writes. The new logic safely caps the size and reports a fatal error.
- **Gateway:** Updated `KTerm_GatewayProcess` to report unknown commands via the new error API (Level: WARNING, Source: API).

## [v2.3.35]

### Hardening & Safety
- **Parser Hardening:** Updated `Stream_ReadInt` and `Stream_ReadHex` in `kt_parser.h` to use `long long` accumulators and check for integer overflows, ensuring robustness against malformed input.
- **Safe Allocations:** Implemented `KTerm_Malloc`, `KTerm_Calloc`, `KTerm_Realloc`, and `KTerm_Free` wrappers in `kterm.h`. `KTerm_Calloc` now checks for multiplication overflows.
- **Refactoring:** Replaced all standard library allocation calls with the new safe wrappers.
- **Testing:** Added `tests/fuzz_harness.c` to support fuzz testing of the input processing pipeline.

## [v2.3.34]

### Unicode Support
- **Unicode Width:** Implemented `mk_wcwidth` logic for accurate character width calculation (0, 1, or 2 cells).
- **Opt-In Control:** Added `enable_wide_chars` flag (default `false`) to `KTermSession` to maintain fixed-width compatibility by default.
- **Gateway:** Added `SET;WIDE_CHARS;ON` command to enable the new logic.
- **Rendering:** Updated `KTerm_ProcessNormalChar` and `KTerm_InsertCharacterAtCursor` to respect character widths when enabled, improving CJK rendering and combining character handling.

## [v2.3.33]

### Protected Cells & Standards
- **Hardened Protected Cells:** Updated `ICH`, `DCH`, `IL`, `DL`, and scroll operations to strictly respect `DECSCA` (Select Character Protection Attribute). Operations are now blocked or modified if they would displace or overwrite protected characters, ensuring compliance with DEC VT520 standards.
- **Smart Protection:** Refined insertion/deletion logic to allow edits if the cursor is past the protected field (non-destructive shifts), improving usability for forms.

## [v2.3.32] (Pre-Release)

### Parser Unification & Robustness
- **Parser Dispatcher:** Introduced `KTerm_DispatchSequence` to centralize execution of all buffered sequences (OSC, DCS, APC, PM, SOS), ensuring uniform termination and error handling.
- **OSC Refactor:** Rewrote `KTerm_ExecuteOSCCommand` and its helpers (`ProcessKTermColorCommand`, `ProcessClipboardCommand`, etc.) to use `StreamScanner`. This eliminates `atoi`/`strchr`, adds robust parsing for `rgb:` colors and Base64 payloads, and aligns with the DCS refactor.
- **DCS Hardening:** Updated `KTerm_ExecuteDCSCommand` to dispatch sub-commands (GATE, XTGETTCAP, DECUDK) using token matching.
- **Safety Fix:** Fixed a potential buffer overflow in `ProcessSoftFontDownload` by adding explicit bounds checks to the `Dscs` string parser loop.
- **Consistency:** Standardized bounds checking in `KTerm_ProcessGenericStringChar`, `KTerm_ProcessOSCChar`, and `KTerm_ProcessDCSChar`.

## [v2.3.31]

### Parser Unification
- **Parser Unification:** Complete unification of parsing logic for OSC and DCS sequences using safe `StreamScanner` primitives.
- **Safe OSC Parsing:** Replaced unsafe string manipulation (e.g., `atoi`, `strchr`) in `KTerm_ExecuteOSCCommand` with safe parsing.
- **Full OSC Color Support:** OSC commands 10, 11, and 12 (Foreground, Background, Cursor Color) now support setting colors via `rgb:rr/gg/bb` syntax, in addition to query functionality.
- **DCS Dispatcher Hardening:** Refactored `KTerm_ExecuteDCSCommand` to use structured token matching instead of brittle `strncmp` checks. This fixes potential ambiguity between Soft Font downloads (`2;1|`) and User Defined Keys (`0;1|`).
- **Memory Safety:** Removed legacy usage of `strdup` in clipboard (OSC 52) and key definition parsing, eliminating potential heap fragmentation and leaks.

## v2.3.30]

### Gateway Protocol Refactor
- **Dispatcher:** Refactored `kt_gateway.h` to use a binary search dispatch table for high-level commands (`SET`, `GET`, `RESET`, `PIPE`, `INIT`), replacing the legacy linear string comparison model. This improves maintainability and extensibility.
- **Parsing Primitives:** Added robust `StreamScanner` primitives (`Stream_ReadIdentifier`, `Stream_ReadBool`, `Stream_MatchToken`, `Stream_PeekChar`) to `kt_parser.h`.
- **Parameter Parsing:** Updated Gateway handlers to leverage these primitives for cleaner, safer, and more efficient parameter extraction (e.g., boolean flags like `ON`/`OFF`, `TRUE`/`FALSE`).
- **Safety:** Enhanced bounds checking and whitespace handling across the Gateway parsing logic.

## [v2.3.29]

### Robustness & Safety
- **CSI Parsing Refactor:** Refactored CSI parameter parsing (`kterm.h`) to use `StreamScanner` primitives. The new implementation robustly handles non-numeric garbage in parameter strings by treating it as a default value (0) and advancing to the next separator (`:` or `;`) or end of string, preventing parsing aborts and data loss.
- **Gateway Quoted Strings:** Enhanced `KTermLexer` in `kt_parser.h` to correctly handle escaped quotes (`\"`) within strings, preventing premature termination.
- **Gateway Unescaping:** Added `KTerm_UnescapeString` utility to process standard escapes (`\n`, `\t`, `\"`, `\\`) in quoted string tokens. Updated `kt_gateway.h` to use this for all string value parsing (e.g., `TEXT`, `FONT` in banners).

## [v2.3.28]

### Refactoring & Safety
- **Centralized Parsing:** Moved parsing primitives (`StreamScanner`, `Stream_ReadInt`) from `kterm.h` to `kt_parser.h` to eliminate code duplication and enforce a single source of truth for parsing logic.
- **Parsing Primitives:** Added `Stream_ReadHex`, `Stream_ReadFloat`, and `Stream_SkipWhitespace` to `kt_parser.h` to support broader parsing requirements.
- **Gateway Hardening:** Refactored `KTerm_ParseColor` in `kt_gateway.h` to use the safe `StreamScanner` primitives instead of `sscanf`, eliminating potential buffer overflow risks and improving parsing consistency.

## [v2.3.27]

### Architecture & Parsing
- **New Tokenizer:** Introduced `KTermLexer` in `kt_parser.h`, a non-destructive, re-entrant tokenizer.
- **Gateway Parsing:** Updated `kt_gateway.h` to use `KTermLexer` for robust parsing of attributes (`SET;ATTR`), keyboard settings, and banners. This eliminates reliance on `strtok` and improves thread safety.
- **Composite Values:** Implemented logic to parse composite values like RGB colors (`UL=255,0,0`) and gradients (`GRADIENT=C1|C2`) using the new lexer stream.
- **Cleanup:** Removed unused legacy tokenizer (`KTerm_Tokenize`) from `kterm.h`.

## [v2.3.26]

### New Features
- **Sixel Gateway Support:** Implemented full Sixel support in the Gateway Protocol, allowing advanced session targeting and control.
    - **Session Targeting:** Added `SET;SIXEL_SESSION;id` to route Sixel graphics to a specific session (rendering target) regardless of the parsing session (source).
    - **Initialization:** Added `INIT;SIXEL_SESSION` to initialize Sixel graphics state on the target session.
    - **Reset Control:** Added `RESET;SIXEL` to clear Sixel graphics state and `RESET;SIXEL_SESSION` to reset the routing target.
- **API Alignment:** Aligned Sixel Gateway commands with existing ReGIS, Tektronix, and Kitty implementations for consistency.

## [v2.3.25]

### Stability & Performance
- **Resize Throttling:** Implemented a resize throttle mechanism in `KTerm_Resize` (limit ~30 FPS) to prevent allocation thrashing and expensive GPU resource recreation during rapid window drag events.
- **Resize Locking:** Added global mutex locking (`KTERM_MUTEX_LOCK`) to `KTerm_Resize` to prevent race conditions with the update loop (`KTerm_Update`) when modifying layout trees and buffers.
- **Precision Mouse:** Upgraded `KTermSit_UpdateMouse` to use floating-point math (`floorf`) and dynamic character dimensions (`term->char_width`) for coordinate calculation, ensuring accuracy on high-DPI displays or when using non-integer scaling.

## [v2.3.24]

### Safety & Stability
- **Gateway Hardening:** Extensive hardening of the Gateway Protocol implementation in `kt_gateway.h`.
    - **Safe String Handling:** Replaced unsafe string functions with bounded alternatives (`SAFE_STRNCPY`, `snprintf`) to prevent buffer overflows.
    - **Heap Allocation:** Moved the `KTerm_GenerateBanner` line buffer (32KB) from the stack to the heap to prevent stack exhaustion on constrained systems.
    - **Robust Parsing:** Replaced `atoi` with `strtol` for safe integer parsing and added comprehensive null-pointer checks to public APIs.
    - **Validation:** Added input validation for Gateway commands to gracefully handle malformed or malicious inputs.

## [v2.3.23]

### New Features
- **Safe Gateway Resize:** Implemented `SET;WIDTH;val` and `SET;HEIGHT;val` commands in the Gateway Protocol, allowing dynamic screen resizing via escape sequences.
- **Safety Limits:** Updated `SET;SIZE` and new resize commands to clamp dimensions to safe internal limits (`KTERM_MAX_COLS` and `KTERM_MAX_ROWS`, default 2048) to prevent memory exhaustion or GPU texture errors.

## [v2.3.22]

### New Features
- **Software Keyboard Repeater Option:** Added `SET;KEYBOARD;REPEAT=SOFTWARE|HOST` to the Gateway Protocol. Users can now choose between the authentic software-based repeater (default, precise VT timing) or standard host OS repeats (lower latency for remote connections).
- **Session Resize Integration:** Updated `DECSLPP` (Set Lines Per Page) to trigger an immediate session resize and reflow via `KTerm_ResizeSession_Internal`. This ensures that changing the logical page size physically resizes the terminal viewport as expected by modern applications.

### Refactoring
- **Input Logic:** Updated `KTermSit_UpdateKeyboard` to conditionally respect the new `use_software_repeat` flag, enabling pass-through of OS repeat events when configured.

## [v2.3.21]

### Refactoring
- **Version Macros:** Defined `KTERM_VERSION_MAJOR`, `MINOR`, `PATCH`, and `REVISION` macros in `kterm.h` to centralize version management.
- **Dynamic Reporting:** Updated the Gateway Protocol (`GET;VERSION`) to report the version string dynamically constructed from these macros, eliminating hardcoded version strings in the implementation.
- **Cleanup:** Removed the manual version number from the `kterm.h` header comment to prevent desynchronization.

## [v2.3.20]

### Refactoring & Optimization
- **Bitwise Feature Flags:** Replaced the `VTFeatures` struct (which contained multiple boolean fields) with a single `uint32_t` bitmask. This change reduces memory footprint, improves cache locality, and aligns with standard C practices for feature flags.
- **Macros:** Defined `KTERM_FEATURE_*` macros for all supported terminal capabilities (e.g., `KTERM_FEATURE_SIXEL_GRAPHICS`, `KTERM_FEATURE_MOUSE_TRACKING`).
- **Struct Reorganization:** Moved `max_session_count` out of the feature flags bitmask and directly into `VTConformance` and `VTLevelFeatureMapping`, as it is an integer value rather than a boolean flag.
- **Codebase Update:** Updated all internal logic in `kterm.h` and `kt_io_sit.h`, as well as test suites, to use bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `~`) for checking and setting features.

## [v2.3.19]

### New Features
- **Esoteric VT510 Features:** Implemented five more rare VT510 control sequences:
    - **DECRQTSR (Request Terminal State Report):** `CSI ? Ps $ u` allows querying the terminal's state, including a "Factory Defaults" report (`DECRQDE`).
    - **DECRQUPSS (Request User-Preferred Supplemental Set):** `CSI ? 26 u` reports the preferred supplemental character set (handled within `DECRQPKU` logic).
    - **DECARR (Set Auto-Repeat Rate):** `CSI Ps SP r` sets the keyboard auto-repeat rate (0-30Hz) and delay.
    - **DECRQDE (Request Default Settings):** Accessible via `DECRQTSR` with Ps=53.
    - **DECST8C (Select Tab Stops every 8 Columns):** `CSI ? 5 W` resets tab stops to standard 8-column intervals.
- **Software Keyboard Repeater:** Implemented a software-based keyboard repeater in `kt_io_sit.h` to support `DECARR`. This suppresses OS/host-level repeats and generates repeats internally with configurable delay and rate, ensuring consistent behavior across platforms.
- **Gateway Protocol:** Added `SET;KEYBOARD;REPEAT_RATE`, `SET;KEYBOARD;DELAY`, and `RESET;TABS;DEFAULT8` to the Gateway Protocol.

## [v2.3.18]

### New Features
- **Esoteric VT510 Features:** Implemented five rare VT510 control sequences:
    - **DECSNLS (Set Number of Lines per Screen):** `CSI Ps * |` changes the physical screen height.
    - **DECSLPP (Set Lines Per Page):** `CSI Ps * {` sets the logical page size (lines per page).
    - **DECXRLM (Transmit XOFF/XON on Receive Limit):** `CSI ? 88 h` enables flow control logic based on input buffer fill levels (75%/25% hysteresis).
    - **DECRQPKU (Request Programmed Key):** `CSI ? 26 ; Ps u` allows querying User-Defined Key (UDK) definitions.
    - **DECSKCV (Select Keyboard Variant):** `CSI Ps SP =` allows setting the keyboard language variant.

## [v2.3.17]

### Refactoring & Stability
- **ExecuteSM/ExecuteRM Refactor:** Completely refactored `ExecuteSM` (Set Mode) and `ExecuteRM` (Reset Mode) to delegate all logic to a centralized `KTerm_SetModeInternal` function. This eliminates code duplication, fixes split logic issues, and ensures consistent behavior for all modes.
- **Mouse Mode Consolidation:** Unified logic for all mouse tracking modes (1000-1016), fixing issues where disabling one mode wouldn't correctly reset the state or would conflict with others.

### New Features
- **Missing DEC Private Modes:** Implemented previously missing modes:
    - **Mode 64 (DECSCCM):** Multi-Session support (Page/Session management).
    - **Mode 67 (DECBKM):** Backarrow Key Mode (restored and verified).
    - **Mode 68 (DECKBUM):** Keyboard Usage Mode.
    - **Mode 103 (DECHDPXM):** Half-Duplex Mode.
    - **Mode 104 (DECESKM):** Secondary Keyboard Language Mode.
- **ANSI Mode 12 (SRM):** Implemented standard ANSI Mode 12 (Send/Receive Mode), correctly mapping it to Local Echo logic (inverted from DEC Private Mode 12).

### Testing
- **Coverage:** Added `tests/test_modes_coverage.c` to rigorously verify SM/RM sequences for critical modes and edge cases (e.g., VT52 transition, mouse mode interactions).

## [v2.3.16]

### New Features
- **DECHDPXM (Half-Duplex Mode):** Implemented DEC Private Mode 103 (DECHDPXM) for VT510 compliance. This mode enables local echo of input characters when set.
- **DECKBUM (Keyboard Usage Mode):** Implemented DEC Private Mode 68 (DECKBUM).
- **DECESKM (Secondary Keyboard Language Mode):** Implemented DEC Private Mode 104 (DECESKM).
- **DECSERA Verification:** Validated implementation of **DECSERA** (Selective Erase Rectangular Area). This function (`CSI ... $ {`) correctly erases characters within a specified rectangle while respecting the protected attribute (`DECSCA`).

## [v2.3.15]

### Critical Fixes
- **Fixed Active Session Context Trap:** Resolved a critical architectural bug where processing input for background sessions would incorrectly modify the currently active (foreground) session's state (cursor position, attributes, modes). Background sessions now update their own internal buffers independently of the display.
- **Multiplexing Stability:** Input routing and command execution are now strictly isolated per session, preventing "ghost cursor" movements and attribute bleeding between split panes.

### Architecture & Refactoring
- **Explicit Session Context:** Refactored internal `Execute*`, `Process*`, and helper functions to accept an explicit `KTermSession*` argument instead of relying on the global `GET_SESSION(term)` macro.
- **Header Reorganization:** Moved `KTermSession` struct definition to the top of `kterm.h`. This ensures inline helper functions (e.g., `GetScreenRow`) can properly dereference session pointers without forward declaration errors.
